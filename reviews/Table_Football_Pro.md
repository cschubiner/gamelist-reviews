## Table Football Pro - Review Summary

### Game Overview
**Table Football Pro** is a digital remake of the classic desktop football/foosball game, developed by Ticklersoft and released on Steam Early Access on May 22, 2017. The game attempts to recreate the tactile experience of table football with physics-based gameplay and extensive multiplayer support.

### Review Sources Found
Due to the game's niche nature and Early Access status, I found **3 primary sources** of feedback:

1. **Steam Store Reviews** - Mixed reception (50% positive from 22 reviews)
2. **Metacritic** - No professional critic reviews available; no user reviews posted
3. **Steam Community Hub** - User discussions and developer feedback

### GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS

**Positive Feedback:**
- Physics-driven gameplay that attempts to simulate real table football mechanics
- Smooth technical performance - one user noted the game "runs flawlessly at max settings"
- Supports both gamepad and mouse controls
- Functional AI opponents for single-player practice

**Concerns:**
- Limited depth compared to expectations for a digital recreation
- Unity UI bugs reported by players
- Mechanics feel basic without much innovation beyond the physical game

---

### FUN FACTOR

**Mixed Reception:**
- Players who enjoyed the original desktop football game appreciated the nostalgic recreation
- Local multiplayer sessions were highlighted as the most enjoyable aspect
- Online play functionality exists but lacks polish
- Early Access limitations diminished long-term engagement
- The novelty of the concept didn't translate to sustained entertainment for many players

### PLAYER COUNT EXPERIENCE

**Strengths:**
- **Exceptional local multiplayer support**: Up to 22 controllers can be connected simultaneously
- Local co-op and split-screen modes available
- Both PvP and player vs. AI modes offered
- Online matchmaking system implemented

**Weaknesses:**
- **Controller detection issues**: Despite advertising 22-controller support, users reported detection limited to "only 4 Xbox 360 gamepads"
- **Poor online interface**: Developer admitted "the online menu really sucks"
- **Lack of communication features**: No in-game chat or communication tools for online play
- **No ranked multiplayer**: Competitive online play was promised but never delivered
- **Limited player base**: Finding online matches proved difficult due to small community

### OVERALL RECEPTION

**Consensus: Mixed to Negative**

**Rating:** 50% positive (13 positive / 11 negative out of 22 Steam reviews)

**Key Issues Affecting Reception:**
1. **Abandoned Development**: The game received its last update over 8 years ago, remaining in perpetual Early Access
2. **Unfulfilled Promises**: Features like ranked play and team customization were announced but never implemented
3. **Limited Value Proposition**: At $1.99, the price is low, but even budget-conscious players questioned the value given the lack of content and polish
4. **Niche Appeal**: The game appeals primarily to nostalgia-seekers familiar with desktop football, limiting broader market appeal

**Positive Notes:**
- Detailed graphics that recreate the physical game aesthetic
- Solid technical foundation with good performance
- Low price point ($1.99)
- 31 Steam achievements for completionists

**Critical Verdict:**
The game has no professional critic reviews on Metacritic or other major gaming outlets, suggesting it flew under the radar of mainstream gaming press. The community consensus indicates a well-intentioned but ultimately incomplete project that failed to evolve beyond its Early Access state.

### CONCLUSION

Table Football Pro represents an interesting concept hampered by execution and abandonment. While the physics-driven gameplay and extensive local multiplayer support (theoretically up to 22 players) show ambition, technical issues, poor online infrastructure, and years without updates have left the game in limbo. The 50/50 split in user reviews reflects a divided audience: those who appreciate the basic recreation of desktop football versus those disappointed by unfulfilled potential and stagnant development.

**Recommendation:** Only suitable for hardcore foosball enthusiasts looking for a digital version to play locally with friends, and only at the current discounted price point.
