# Project Planet - Earth vs Humanity

## Game Overview
Project Planet is an asymmetric multiplayer strategy party game featuring impossible dilemmas and choices-matter mechanics. One player takes on the role of Planet Earth attempting to destroy humanity, while up to five other players assume roles as World Leaders, Industry, Media, Scientists, and the Public, trying to survive the ecological apocalypse through cooperation and negotiation.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Asymmetric multiplayer: 1 player as Earth vs up to 5 players as humanity
- Six distinct roles: Planet Earth, World Leaders, Industry, Media, Scientists, and Public
- Choices-matter gameplay with branching paths and consequences
- Mobile devices used as controllers with hidden input mechanics
- Browser-based input on phones/tablets, results displayed on shared screen
- Social deduction and negotiation elements
- Strategic resource management and decision-making
- Extensive cutscenes and narrative elements

## Fun Factor
Project Planet creates tense, engaging scenarios that spark genuine debate and discussion among players. The asymmetric nature where one player actively works against the others adds exciting tension. The game's strength lies in the social interactions it provokes, with players negotiating, forming alliances, and making difficult choices under pressure. However, the fun can be hindered by the awkward interface that requires switching between browser and application, which disrupts the flow. Best enjoyed with groups who appreciate social deduction and don't mind a learning curve.
