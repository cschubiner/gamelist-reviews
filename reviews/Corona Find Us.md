# Corona Find Us

## Overview
**Platform:** PC (Steam)
**Players:** 2-16 players (smartphone controllers + shared screen)
**Price:** $3.99 on Steam (often 50% discount)
**Release Date:** Released on Steam
**Developer/Publisher:** Unknown

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Corona Find Us is a party game themed around the COVID-19 pandemic, where players control nano-technology robots tasked with destroying coronavirus within people's lungs. The game features shared/split-screen co-op gameplay with no theoretical limit on player numbers, though practically supports 2-16 players.

**Control System:**
Players use smartphones as controllers to pilot their nano robots. This smartphone control approach eliminates the need for multiple physical controllers and makes the game accessible to casual groups where everyone has their own mobile device.

**Objective:**
Navigate through representations of human lungs, cleaning areas contaminated with coronavirus and other bacteria/viruses. The gameplay appears to be arcade-style action focused on area clearance and enemy elimination.

**Visual Presentation:**
The game presents the inside of lungs as playable arenas where nano robots battle virus particles, creating a sci-fi medical visualization of microscopic combat.

## Fun Factor

Community reactions to Corona Find Us are sharply divided:

**Positive Perspectives:**
- One reviewer called it "very funny"
- Another described it as "a fine arcade game about cleaning area from bacteria and different virus"

**Critical Perspectives:**
- Labeled as a "trashy action game" by detractors
- Complaints about "annoying" music
- At least one reviewer expressed intention to refund
- Requests for more level variety suggest content limitations

The pandemic theme may feel dated or in poor taste for some players, particularly those negatively affected by COVID-19. What seemed timely or humorous during peak pandemic times may now feel exploitative or tone-deaf.

## Player Count Experience

**Supported:** 2-16 players (smartphone controllers)
**Optimal:** 4-8 players (estimated)
**Display:** Shared/split-screen on PC

The smartphone controller system and support for up to 16 players creates accessibility for large groups. However, the shared/split-screen format may become cluttered or difficult to follow with maximum player counts.

Reports of limited level variety suggest the game may not maintain engagement even with optimal player counts. The novelty of smartphone controls can't compensate for insufficient content or repetitive gameplay.

## Technical Considerations

**Platform:** PC (Steam) with smartphone controllers
**Audio:** Criticized as "annoying" by reviewers
**Content:** Limited levels based on user feedback
**Theme:** Pandemic-related content may be sensitive

The smartphone control system requires players to have compatible mobile devices and likely needs local network connectivity or a companion app/website for controller functionality.

## Overall Reception

**Steam User Score:** Mixed based on available feedback
**Price Point:** $3.99 (budget title)

## Verdict

Corona Find Us represents a budget party game attempting to capitalize on pandemic themes with accessible smartphone controls and large player counts. While some players find entertainment in the arcade action and nano-robot concept, the overall execution appears problematic.

The most significant issues are the divisive pandemic theme (which may offend or upset players affected by COVID-19), limited content variety, and mixed quality execution. Even supporters acknowledge content limitations by requesting more levels. The "trashy" assessment and refund intentions from some players suggest fundamental quality concerns beyond just theme sensitivity.

At $3.99, the price is low, but even budget titles need to justify their cost with quality content and respectful themes. The pandemic timing feels exploitative rather than satirical or educational, and the limited level variety suggests insufficient development investment.

**Recommendation Status:** Not recommended

**Why Not Recommended:**
- Potentially offensive or insensitive pandemic theme
- Limited content (level variety complaints)
- Mixed quality execution ("trashy" criticism)
- "Annoying" audio design
- Some players seeking refunds
- Better alternatives exist even at budget prices
- Theme may be dated or in poor taste post-pandemic

**Might Consider If:**
- You're specifically looking for pandemic-themed content
- You're collecting unusual/quirky party games
- You find the nano-robot concept uniquely appealing
- You're buying during steep discount and have minimal expectations
- Your group has dark humor and isn't offended by COVID themes

**Better Alternatives:**
Numerous other smartphone-controlled party games exist with less controversial themes and better execution - research alternatives before settling for this title
