# The Jackbox Survey Scramble

## Overview
The Jackbox Survey Scramble is a standalone party game from Jackbox Games that takes the classic "guess the survey answer" format (similar to Family Feud) and transforms it into four distinct game modes. Released as a focused experience rather than a full Party Pack, the game supports 2-10 players with an additional 10,000 audience members, making it ideal for streamers and large gatherings.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The Jackbox Survey Scramble centers on a simple but engaging core concept: players guess answers to survey questions. Despite this unified premise, the four game modes play surprisingly differently:

**Game Modes:**
- **HILO:** Individual competition mode
- **SPEED:** Fast-paced individual competition
- **SQUARES:** Team-based mode dividing players into groups
- **BOUNCE:** Team-based competitive mode

All modes are quick to play and easy to understand, making them perfect for groups of varying skill levels and gaming experience. The games are accessible enough for non-gamers while still providing enough depth to keep experienced players engaged.

Like other Jackbox titles, players use their phones, tablets, or computers to participate, with the main game displayed on a shared screen (TV, monitor, or streaming setup). This accessibility means anyone with a web-capable device can join.

## Fun Factor
The Jackbox Survey Scramble delivers the signature Jackbox fun in a more focused package. The survey-guessing format naturally creates moments of surprise, debate, and laughter as players try to predict what others said. The variety in game modes prevents the experience from feeling repetitive, despite all modes sharing the same basic mechanic.

Reviews praise the game for feeling "just as full and engaging as a proper Party Pack" (9/10) despite being technically one game with variations. The quick pace makes it ideal for shorter gaming sessions or as a warm-up/cooldown game in longer party game marathons.

The massive audience support (10,000 participants) makes it particularly well-suited for streaming, where viewers can actively participate rather than just watch.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** 2-10 active players + up to 10,000 audience members

The game scales well across its player range:
- **2-4 Players:** More strategic, focused competition
- **5-7 Players:** Ideal sweet spot for most groups
- **8-10 Players:** Maximum chaos and variety in answers
- **Audience Mode:** Perfect for streaming or large events where many want to participate

**Team Modes:** SQUARES and BOUNCE divide players into teams, adding cooperative elements
**Individual Modes:** HILO and SPEED focus on solo competition

The games are designed to be quick, making them excellent for rotating players in and out or for situations where people need to step away briefly.
