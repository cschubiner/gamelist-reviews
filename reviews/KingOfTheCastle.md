# King Of The Castle

## Overview
King Of The Castle is a unique multiplayer game of shifting power dynamics and political intrigue developed by Tributary Games and published by Team17. Released with strong reception, the game allows one player to take the role of a Monarch while 3-24 other players join as Nobles of the Council, voting on decisions that shape the kingdom's fate. With special support for Twitch streamers allowing unlimited audience participation, the game offers both intimate party experiences and massive community events.

## Fun Factor
King Of The Castle excels at creating dramatic, heated moments as Nobles bicker over voting options while the Monarch attempts to manage (or manipulate) the chaos. Reviews highlight how the game becomes "delightfully heated" during matches, with political maneuvering and shifting alliances creating memorable social experiences.

The game rewards both the Monarch's ability to read and influence their Council, and the Nobles' strategic voting and coalition-building. The potential for overthrow adds real stakes to decisions, keeping all players engaged.
