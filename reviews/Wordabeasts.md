# Wordabeasts

## Game Overview
Wordabeasts is a multiplayer party game where players receive words on their mobile devices and try to quickly think of a single clue word that connects them together. Players earn points both for guessing other players' words and for having their own words correctly guessed.

## Platforms

- Free-to-play

## Pricing
Free-to-play on Steam

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Each player uses their mobile device as a controller by entering a code displayed on screen. Players receive multiple words and must think of a creative clue word that connects them. The challenge is finding connections that are clear enough for others to guess but clever enough to be interesting.

The game rewards:
- Quick thinking (speed matters)
- Creative connections
- Understanding how others think
- Strategic clue-giving

## Fun Factor
The word association mechanics create moments of hilarity when players make unexpected connections or completely miss obvious ones. Being free-to-play removes barriers to trying it with friends. The mobile device integration makes it accessible without needing multiple controllers.

## Player Count Experience
- **Optimal Range**: 5-8 players
- **Minimum**: 3 players
- **Maximum**: 8 players
More players create more opportunities for creative and unexpected word associations, though the game remains playable with the minimum count.

## Overall Reception
Mixed reception with a relatively small player base. The free-to-play model is appreciated, but the game hasn't gained significant traction.
