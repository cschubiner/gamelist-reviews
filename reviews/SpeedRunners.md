# SpeedRunners

## Overview
SpeedRunners is a 4-player competitive platformer featuring grappling hooks, power-ups, and interactive environments. Originally released on PC and later ported to Nintendo Switch, the game has become a beloved multiplayer title praised for its fast-paced action, competitive depth, and excellent party game credentials.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
SpeedRunners is a 2D side-scrolling competitive platformer where up to 4 players race through looping courses. The goal isn't just reaching the finish line - players compete to keep ahead of the camera. Fall too far behind and you're eliminated from the round.

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Grappling Hooks:** Swing across gaps and gain momentum
- **Power-ups and Items:** Missiles, grappling hook pulls, boosts, and other items to sabotage opponents
- **Interactive Environments:** Destructible elements and dynamic obstacles
- **Speed Maintenance:** Building and maintaining momentum is crucial
- **Elimination System:** Camera follows the lead, eliminating trailing players

The game emphasizes skill-based movement with simple controls that allow for complex maneuvers. While easy to pick up, the game rewards practice and mastery. Competitive players can find significant depth in optimizing routes, timing grapples, and using items strategically.

**Level Design:**
The courses loop continuously with varied terrain, hazards, and shortcuts. Great level design provides multiple paths and opportunities for skilled players to gain advantages while keeping matches close and exciting.

## Fun Factor
SpeedRunners excels as a multiplayer party game, delivering energetic, frantic competition. The ability to sabotage opponents with well-timed items creates hilarious and memorable moments. Flinging a missile at a friend about to reach the finish line or pulling another back with your grappling hook generates genuine excitement and friendly rivalry.

The game truly shines when played locally where you can see opponents' reactions. Reviews consistently emphasize that watching friends' faces as they're sabotaged or eliminated adds significantly to the fun.

The simple premise masks surprising depth. While newcomers can jump in and have fun immediately, skilled players can pull off advanced techniques and dominate through superior movement and item usage. This skill ceiling creates longevity for competitive groups.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** 1-4 players (local and online multiplayer)

SpeedRunners is designed around 4-player competition:
- **2 Players:** Head-to-head competition with intense focus
- **3-4 Players:** Ideal player count for maximum chaos and strategy
- **Online Multiplayer:** Compete with players worldwide
- **Local Multiplayer:** Couch co-op for the best experience (Steam Big Picture mode recommended)

**Single-Player Limitations:**
While the game includes a campaign mode with bot opponents, reviews consistently note that single-player "works more like training sections" for multiplayer. The AI provides practice but can't replicate the excitement and unpredictability of playing with friends. Single-player is functional but not the main attraction.

**Local vs. Online:**
Both critics and players emphasize that local multiplayer is significantly more fun than online. Being able to see opponent reactions and trash-talk in person elevates the experience considerably, making it a perfect party game.
