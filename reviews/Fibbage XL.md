# Fibbage XL Review

## Overview
Fibbage XL is a standalone bluffing party game from Jackbox Games, originally featured in The Jackbox Party Pack. This expanded version contains all the questions from the original Fibbage plus 50% more content, making it a significantly larger experience. Hosted by the "famous-ish and very desperate" Cookie Masterson from the YOU DON'T KNOW JACK series, it's a game of creative lying and deductive reasoning.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Players are presented with an obscure trivia fact that's missing one key detail. Each player must write a fake answer to fill in the blank, trying to make it believable enough to fool other players. Once all fake answers are submitted along with the real answer, players vote on which one they think is true.

Points are awarded for:
- Fooling other players with your fake answer
- Correctly identifying the real answer
- Earning the "Thumbs Cup" for especially clever responses

The gameplay loop is simple but creates hilarious moments as players craft increasingly absurd lies and struggle to identify the truth among creative falsehoods.

## Fun Factor
Fibbage XL excels at creating memorable party moments. The game rewards creativity and wit, encouraging players to think outside the box when crafting their deceptions. The obscure nature of the real facts often means even the most ridiculous answer could be true, leading to genuine surprise and laughter.

The host, Cookie Masterson, adds personality and humor to the experience, keeping energy high between rounds. The addition of the Thumbs Cup rewards particularly clever answers even if they don't win votes, recognizing that sometimes the journey is more entertaining than the destination.

## Player Count Experience
- **Players:** 2-8 players
- **Audience:** Additional spectators can participate in voting
- **Best For:** Groups of 4-8 players

The game works best with larger groups where there are more fake answers to choose from and more opportunities for creative deception. With only 2-3 players, the limited number of fake answers makes it easier to identify the truth.

## Platforms

- Nintendo Switch
- PlayStation
- Xbox
- macOS (App Store)
- **Controller:** Smartphones, tablets, or keyboards

## Pricing
- **Steam:** $6.99 (currently on sale for $2.44 - 65% off)
- **Nintendo Switch:** Check eShop for current pricing

## Overall Reception

### Critical Scores
Strong positive reception as a standalone party game and as part of The Jackbox Party Pack.

### Strengths
- 50% more content than original Fibbage
- Simple, accessible gameplay mechanics
- Rewards creativity and wit
- Cookie Masterson hosting adds personality
- Thumbs Cup recognizes clever answers
- No special equipment needed - phones/tablets as controllers
- Quick rounds keep energy high

- Affordable pricing

### Weaknesses
- Better with larger groups (4+ players)
- Content can become familiar after many playthroughs
- Requires players who enjoy creative writing
- Some obscure facts may frustrate trivia purists

## Verdict
Fibbage XL is an excellent party game that rewards quick thinking, creativity, and the ability to lie convincingly. The expanded content over the original version provides good value, and the simple phone-as-controller setup makes it accessible to any group. While it's been included in later Jackbox Party Packs (Quiplash 2 and 3 follow similar formulas), the standalone XL version offers a focused experience at a budget price. Best enjoyed with 4+ creative friends who don't mind bending the truth for entertainment.
