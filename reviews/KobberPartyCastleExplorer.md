# KobberParty - Castle Explorer

## Overview
KobberParty - Castle Explorer is a fast-paced dungeon dweller party game supporting up to 9999 players. Released on March 20, 2020, this passion project by a single developer casts players as courageous (or foolish) heroes braving the legendary dangers of a randomly generated castle dungeon. Players use phones, laptops, tablets, or other HTML-compatible devices to make choices while the action unfolds on a TV or shared screen.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
KobberParty - Castle Explorer combines roguelike dungeon exploration with party game accessibility, creating a unique multiplayer experience where massive player counts can participate simultaneously.

**Core Gameplay:**
- **Randomly Generated Dungeons:** Each playthrough features procedurally generated layouts filled with traps, treasures, and monsters
- **Device-Based Controls:** Players make decisions on their personal devices (phones, tablets, laptops) via HTML browser
- **Shared Display:** Main action and dungeon exploration happens on TV/shared screen
- **Wealth Competition:** Players compete to amass the most treasure while surviving dungeon dangers

**Risk-Reward Mechanics:**
Players must balance greed with survival - delving deeper offers greater fortune but increases danger. Strategic choices include:
- When to push forward vs. retreat
- Resource management
- Navigating deadly traps
- Battling monstrous creatures
- Outsmarting friends for competitive advantage

**Accessibility:**
The browser-based control system means only one person needs to own the game, with all other players joining free via their devices at a simple web address. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for large groups.

## Fun Factor
KobberParty delivers the excitement of dungeon exploration adapted for party game accessibility. The randomly generated dungeons ensure variety across sessions, while the competitive treasure-hunting creates natural tension and rivalries.

The massive player support (up to 9999) is remarkable, theoretically allowing entire communities, schools, or events to participate simultaneously. More realistically, even supporting dozens of players makes it viable for large gatherings where most party games max out at 8-16 players.

The browser-based system eliminates technical hassles - no controller sharing, no install requirements for additional players, just connect and play.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** Up to 9999 players (theoretical maximum)

**Practical Scaling:**
- **3-8 Players:** Intimate dungeon crawling with personal dynamics
- **9-20 Players:** Large party experience with complex interactions
- **21-50+ Players:** Community event scale (classrooms, gaming clubs, conventions)
- **50-9999 Players:** Theoretical support for massive gatherings

The HTML-based controls via personal devices make supporting huge player counts technically feasible, though practical player counts will likely be much lower for most use cases.

**Setup:**
Players join by navigating to a simple web address on any HTML-compatible device, making onboarding fast and accessible. Only the host needs to purchase the game.

## Platforms
- PC (Steam)
- Playable on any HTML-compatible device (phones, tablets, laptops) for participants

## Pricing
- $4.99 (Steam)

## Overall Reception

**Status:** Limited review data available

As a solo developer passion project released in 2020, KobberParty - Castle Explorer has a modest profile with limited formal reviews. The game serves a niche audience of large-group party gamers and represents an ambitious undertaking for a single developer.

The 9999 player support and browser-based accessibility demonstrate innovative thinking in addressing the technical challenges of massive multiplayer party games. The $4.99 price point makes it an affordable experiment for groups curious about large-scale party gaming.

### Strengths
- Supports up to 9999 players (theoretical)
- Browser-based controls (phones, tablets, laptops)
- Only host needs to purchase game
- Randomly generated dungeons for replay value
- Solo developer passion project showing dedication
- Affordable pricing ($4.99)
- High-fantasy dungeon theme
- Risk-reward gameplay creates tension
- Accessible for large events/communities
- Eliminates controller requirements

### Weaknesses
- Very limited review data and community feedback
- Solo developer may mean slower updates/limited support
- Unknown gameplay depth and balance
- Graphics and production values likely modest
- May have technical issues with extreme player counts
- Smaller player base
- Limited marketing/awareness
- Unclear content depth for long-term play

### Who Should Play
KobberParty - Castle Explorer is ideal for:
- Large gaming communities seeking massive multiplayer support
- Schools and educational settings with many participants
- Convention and event organizers
- Gaming clubs and organizations
- Budget-conscious party game seekers
- Groups with mixed device availability
- Fans of dungeon crawling themes
- Supporters of solo indie developers

**Particularly Strong For:**
- Events where 20+ people want to play simultaneously
- Situations where controller availability is limited
- Groups that want low-cost, high-player-count options
- Communities seeking accessible entry (browser-based)

The 9999 player theoretical maximum and $4.99 price make this game particularly attractive for large-scale events and communities. The browser-based system solves many technical challenges that typically limit party games to 8-16 players.

Not recommended for players seeking AAA production values, deep single-player content, or extensively reviewed and tested experiences. The solo developer and modest community mean you're taking a chance on a niche title, though the low price reduces risk.
