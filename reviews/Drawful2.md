# Drawful 2

## Game Overview
Drawful 2 is the game of terrible drawings and hilariously wrong answers from Jackbox Games. Players draw prompts on their phones or tablets, others guess what the drawings are, and everyone votes on what they think is the correct answer.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Players receive ridiculous prompts and must draw them on their phone/tablet
- Other players create fake answers for what they think the drawing represents
