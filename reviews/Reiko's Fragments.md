# Reiko's Fragments

## Overview
**Platform:** PC (Steam), VR (Oculus Rift, Meta Store, Viveport)
**Players:** 1 VR player + multiple smartphone/tablet/web-enabled device users
**Price:** Available on Steam, Meta Store, and Viveport
**Release Date:** Available across multiple VR platforms
**Developer/Publisher:** Unknown

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Reiko's Fragments is an asymmetric horror party game combining FPS/VR mechanics with crowd participation. One player explores a haunted house in VR while friends, family, or even stream viewers use web-enabled devices to control the environment, place traps, and trigger jump scares.

**VR Player Experience:**
The VR player navigates a two-floor haunted house, solving puzzles while being hunted by a vengeful ghost. They can throw items to distract the ghost, but their primary objective is to escape by finding a creepy doll hidden somewhere in the house. The gameplay blends escape room puzzle-solving with survival horror elements.

**Crowd Player Experience:**
Non-VR players use smartphones, tablets, or any web-enabled device to:
- Place traps throughout the house
- Trigger jump scares at strategic moments
- Control environmental elements
- Collaborate to terrorize or assist the VR player

The web-based interface requires no app downloads, making participation highly accessible for crowds at parties or for stream viewers watching someone play.

## Fun Factor

Reiko's Fragments successfully delivers genuine scares, described as "genuinely scary" in reviews. The asymmetric gameplay creates entertaining dynamics where the VR player experiences terror while crowd participants enjoy orchestrating the horror. This role reversal - usually the audience watches passively while one person plays horror games, but here the audience actively participates in creating the scares - adds a unique social element.

The couch party game format with horror themes provides plenty of "screams and thrills" for gatherings. The combination of puzzle-solving and survival horror keeps the VR player engaged beyond just being scared, while crowd players have meaningful agency in affecting the experience.

## Player Count Experience

**Supported:** 1 VR player + unlimited crowd participants (via web devices)
**Optimal:** 1 VR player + 3-8 active crowd participants
**Stream Integration:** Supports stream viewers as participants

The game's web-based crowd participation system allows theoretically unlimited players to join and contribute scares/traps. This makes it particularly suitable for streaming scenarios where viewers can participate in tormenting the streamer, or for large party settings where many people want to be involved.

However, too many simultaneous crowd players might create chaos that overwhelms the VR player's experience. Moderate crowd sizes (3-8 active participants) likely provide the best balance between engagement and playability.

## Technical Considerations

**VR Requirements:** Requires VR headset (Oculus Rift, Meta Quest, or compatible headsets)
**Crowd Access:** Web-enabled devices only (no app download required)
**Platform Availability:** Multi-platform VR support increases accessibility

The web-based crowd participation is a significant technical advantage, eliminating app download friction that could prevent casual participants from joining. This design choice maximizes inclusivity for party settings.

## Overall Reception

**Critical Reception:** Recognized as horror couch party game, praised for scary atmosphere

### Strengths:
- Genuinely scary horror atmosphere
- Innovative asymmetric VR + crowd gameplay
- Web-based participation (no app downloads)
- Supports unlimited crowd participants
- Stream integration for viewer participation
- Two-floor haunted house with puzzle elements
- Social party game format for horror fans

### Weaknesses:
- Mixed (66%) Steam reviews indicate divided reception

- Requires VR headset for core player

- Puzzle solutions may become known after repeated plays

## Verdict

Reiko's Fragments successfully carves out a unique niche as a horror-focused asymmetric VR party game. The combination of genuine scares for the VR player and participatory control for crowd members creates entertaining social dynamics perfect for parties, game nights, or streaming content.

The 66% positive rating indicates mixed reception - likely this reflects the game appealing strongly to its target audience (horror fans, VR party game enthusiasts, streamers) while disappointing those seeking different experiences or encountering technical issues. The horror genre focus inherently limits appeal to those comfortable with scary games.

For VR owners who enjoy horror games and frequently host gaming sessions or stream, Reiko's Fragments offers a distinctive experience that leverages VR's immersive qualities while keeping non-VR participants engaged. The web-based crowd participation is particularly clever, lowering barriers to entry for casual participants.

**Recommended for:** Horror game fans, VR streamers, party hosts with VR equipment, asymmetric multiplayer enthusiasts, groups seeking scary social experiences, escape room fans

**Not recommended for:** Those who dislike horror games, players without VR headsets, solo players without crowd participation, groups uncomfortable with scary content, those seeking non-horror party games

**Best Use Cases:** Streaming with viewer participation, Halloween parties, horror-themed game nights, introducing friends to VR in social settings
