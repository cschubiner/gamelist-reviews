# Tic Tac Together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Tic Tac Together is a team-based twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game that supports up to 12 players. The core innovation is that all moves are placed on the board simultaneously each round, creating strategic chaos and excitement. When X's and O's are placed in the same space, teams must compete on a smaller board to claim that spot, adding an extra layer of competitive tension.

Players can join directly from their phones or web browsers through a simple interface that requires no downloads, making it extremely accessible for party gaming. The game is highly customizable, allowing hosts to adjust the number of moves per player, the presence of inner boards at game start, team sizes, and time limits for entering moves to create varied gameplay experiences.

## Fun Factor

The simultaneous placement mechanic transforms the traditional turn-based nature of Tic Tac Toe into something far more engaging and unpredictable. The tension of potentially clashing with opponent moves and having to resolve disputes through mini-battles keeps players on their toes. The scalability to 12 players makes it ideal for larger gatherings, and the customizable settings ensure that gameplay can be tailored to different group preferences and skill levels.

The lack of required downloads and phone-based control system removes technical barriers, letting groups jump right into the action. This accessibility combined with familiar mechanics makes it easy to explain but difficult to master.

## Player Count Experience

Tic Tac Together shines with larger groups, supporting 2-12 players who can form teams of various sizes. The team-based structure encourages collaboration and discussion among teammates while maintaining the competitive spirit against opponents. The ability to customize team sizes means the game can accommodate both small gatherings and large parties effectively.

The simultaneous turn system ensures that all players remain engaged throughout the game, eliminating the downtime typical of traditional turn-based Tic Tac Toe. This design choice is particularly valuable with higher player counts, where waiting for turns would otherwise become tedious.
