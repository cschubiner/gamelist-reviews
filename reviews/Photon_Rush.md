### **FUN FACTOR**

While professional critic reviews are scarce, available commentary suggests:
- Praised as "a great, fast-paced co-op game"
- Compared favorably to "oldschool Snake with power-ups and coop"
- Positioned as a social party game for friends and family gatherings
- The 30-second round structure keeps gameplay energetic and accessible
- One reviewer noted it's "one of few games" that can support 16 local players

**Limitations noted:**
- Controller compatibility issues reported (related to the Rewired input system)
- Some users mentioned the game "used to be playable with controllers," suggesting technical problems emerged

### **PLAYER COUNT EXPERIENCE**

**Supported Players:**
- Up to 16 players on one screen simultaneously
- Local multiplayer only (no online play mentioned)
- Designed specifically as a party/social game

**Player Statistics (from SteamSpy):**
- **Ownership**: 0-20,000 copies on Steam
- **Current Activity**: 0 concurrent players in recent tracking
- **Average Playtime**: 6 hours 16 minutes

The relatively low player count and zero concurrent players suggest a small, niche audience, though the 6+ hour average playtime indicates those who do play find it engaging enough for extended sessions.

- **6 curator reviews**: All positive

### **CONCLUSION**

Photon Rush appears to be a niche local multiplayer party game with a small but dedicated audience. The game's unique selling point—supporting 16 players on one screen—is praised, but limited critical coverage and minimal player activity suggest it hasn't gained significant traction in the market. The positive sentiment from those who have reviewed it focuses on its accessibility and fast-paced action, making it suitable for casual gaming sessions with friends and family. However, technical issues and lack of visibility have likely hindered broader adoption.
