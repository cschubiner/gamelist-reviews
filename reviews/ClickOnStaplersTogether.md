# Click on staplers together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on staplers together is a multiplayer hidden object game featuring an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic scene containing 100+ staplers to locate. Players compete to find and click staplers, claiming them in their chosen color before opponents can discover them.

Navigation is accomplished by clicking and dragging with the mouse to pan across the detailed artwork, or alternatively using keyboard controls (WASD, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) or gamepads. This multi-input support enables different players to use their preferred control method simultaneously.

When a player finds a stapler, clicking it marks it in their selected color and adds it to their score. A final scoreboard displays each player's discoveries once all objects are found. The game offers customizable color themes to reduce eye strain during extended play sessions.

Multiplayer connectivity options include local play with various input devices, Steam Remote Play, LAN over WiFi, and experimental online play that doesn't require port forwarding. The experimental P2P system requires both host and player to enter each other's IP addresses.

The game features no time limit, creating a relaxed atmosphere that prioritizes social interaction over competitive pressure.

## Fun Factor

Click on staplers together offers a quirky, stress-free competitive experience. The unusual theme of searching for office staplers creates a humorous premise that stands out from more conventional hidden object themes. The detailed hand-drawn artwork makes the search visually interesting despite the mundane subject matter.

The "Hard" difficulty rating indicates the staplers are cleverly hidden throughout the scene, providing a genuine challenge that rewards careful observation and pattern recognition. This difficulty level creates more satisfying "aha!" moments when particularly tricky staplers are discovered.

The competitive element remains gentle despite the challenge - players race to find objects but without time pressure, allowing for conversation and social bonding during play. The 100+ hidden objects provide substantial gameplay for extended sessions.

## Player Count Experience

Click on staplers together supports unlimited players, constrained only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) provides flexibility for different group sizes and technical setups.

The shared-screen format creates a communal experience where all players view the same panoramic scene. This enables real-time reactions, friendly banter, and shared excitement when difficult objects are found. The color-coded marking system provides immediate visual feedback on everyone's progress.

The game scales across player counts effectively. Solo players can enjoy a challenging search experience, pairs engage in direct competition, and larger groups create more dynamic races where objects are claimed rapidly. However, the very limited review data (only 3 reviews) suggests it hasn't attracted a large player base yet.

## Overall Reception

**Steam Rating:** Insufficient data (only 3 user reviews)

**Price:** Variable with sales (51% discount noted)

**Platform:** Steam (PC), multiple input methods supported

**Difficulty:** Hard

Click on staplers together is part of the "Click on things together" franchise, offering the same core gameplay with different themes. The quirky stapler theme may appeal to players seeking more unusual or humorous hidden object challenges compared to more conventional themes.

The "Hard" difficulty distinguishes it within the franchise, potentially attracting players who found other entries too easy. However, the extremely limited review count (only 3 reviews) suggests it's a very niche title that hasn't gained significant traction even within the hidden object community.

The substantial discount (51% off) indicates aggressive pricing to attract buyers, though the lack of reviews suggests marketing or discovery challenges. Players interested in the franchise should consider that limited reviews mean less community feedback on quality and difficulty accuracy.
