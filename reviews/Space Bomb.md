## Game Overview
Space Bomb is a multiplayer battle arena game where up to 6 players compete online or offline using various types of bombs with different effects. Players navigate through arenas filled with traps and obstacles while competing in team-based combat (red team vs blue team).

## Platforms

## Player Count
- Up to 6 players
- Online multiplayer
- Offline/local multiplayer
- Team-based (Blue vs Red)

## Pricing
$6.99 USD on Steam (Early Access)

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Players take on the role of an astronaut captured during space travel and forced to fight in arena battles. The core gameplay revolves around:
- Using various bomb types with different effects
- Team-based combat (blue vs red teams)
- Navigating arena traps and obstacles
- Finding a way to return to Earth through combat victories

The game is in Early Access, meaning it's not complete and may or may not receive further development.

## Fun Factor
The bomb-based combat mechanics and arena obstacles create potential for chaotic multiplayer fun. However, the Early Access state and lack of recent updates suggest the game may not have achieved its full potential or vision.

## Player Count Experience
- **Optimal Range**: 4-6 players
- **Minimum**: 2 players (presumably)
- **Maximum**: 6 players
Team-based arena combat works best with balanced teams, so 4 or 6 players would provide the most competitive experience.

## Overall Reception
Very limited reception with virtually no critical coverage. The game appears to be abandoned or in development limbo.

### Review Scores
- Metacritic: No user score (not enough reviews to generate score)
- Steam: Limited user reviews
- Last developer update: Over 5 years ago

### Notable Comments
**Major Concerns:**
- Development appears abandoned (last update 5+ years ago)
- Early Access game that may never be completed
- Minimal player base
- No critical review coverage
- Steam's Early Access warning applies: "This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development."

The lack of updates and reviews suggests potential buyers should be very cautious, as the game may never leave Early Access or receive further improvements.
