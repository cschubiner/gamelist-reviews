# ROUNDS

## Gameplay & Mechanics

ROUNDS is a 1v1 rogue-lite shooter that combines fast-paced gunplay with strategic deck-building elements. The game's core innovation lies in its round-based progression system: after each round concludes, the losing player gets to select clever upgrades to create a better build to counter their opponent, while the winner also gains upgrades to maintain their advantage.

This creates an escalating arms race where each round becomes more intense and chaotic as players accumulate more powerful abilities and modifications. The rogue-lite elements mean that builds are created on the fly during matches rather than pre-planned, requiring adaptation and strategic thinking based on what your opponent is doing.

The gameplay emphasizes skillful shooting combined with smart upgrade selection. Players must balance offensive firepower with defensive capabilities, mobility, and utility, creating diverse builds that can counter different strategies. The rounds system ensures that matches remain dynamic, as a player who loses early can mount a comeback through strategic upgrade choices.

The game supports both online and local couch multiplayer modes, allowing for competitive play whether friends are in the same room or connected remotely.

## Fun Factor

ROUNDS has been praised for having gunplay that players find "more fun than games like Apex Legends," which is high praise given Apex's reputation for satisfying combat. The creative mechanics and upgrade system lead to humorous and unpredictable moments as builds become increasingly overpowered and absurd.

The tension of each round matters - losing gives you upgrade choices, but winning keeps momentum. This creates interesting psychological dynamics where sometimes a loss can set you up for future success through strategic upgrade selection. The escalating power levels ensure that matches remain exciting from start to finish.

The 1v1 focus creates intense, personal competition where every decision and shot matters. The ability to customize and build your character mid-match means no two games play the same way, providing significant replayability. The unpredictability of build combinations leads to memorable moments and emergent gameplay scenarios.

## Player Count Experience

ROUNDS is strictly a 1v1 experience, making it a focused competitive duel rather than a party game for larger groups. This limitation means it's best suited for:
- One-on-one competition between friends
- Tournament brackets where players face off sequentially
- Intimate gaming sessions focused on skill-based competition

While the 1v1 format limits the simultaneous player count, it allows for a more refined, balanced competitive experience where there's no confusion about who's responsible for victories or defeats. The game works well as a "winner stays on" format for small groups where players take turns facing each other.

Some players have expressed that they'd like to see expanded player counts or game modes, though mods are available that address some of these limitations. The core experience is clearly designed around 1v1 dueling, and that focus allows for tight, skill-based gameplay.

**Platform:** Windows (Steam), supports both online and couch multiplayer

ROUNDS has received exceptional critical and user acclaim, with "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews on Steam representing one of the highest rating tiers available. With nearly 29,000 reviews maintaining a 95% positive rating, it's clear the game has found a dedicated audience.

Players consistently praise the creative mechanics, engaging gunplay, and high replay value. The game has been described as having "massive replay value" in reviews. The combination of rogue-lite progression with competitive shooting creates a unique experience that stands out in the crowded shooter genre.

Common criticisms focus on the limited features regarding game customization (no way to change round counts or game modes in vanilla) and the restriction to 1v1 gameplay only. However, these limitations haven't significantly impacted the overwhelmingly positive reception, and mods are available to address some concerns.
