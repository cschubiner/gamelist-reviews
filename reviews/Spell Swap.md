## Overview
Spell Swap is a chaotic wizard vs wizard 2D fighting game with a unique twist: the last spell you cast will come back right at your face. If you manage to hit another player with your spell, you can swap your spell with theirs, creating a dynamic where spell management is as important as aiming and dodging.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game features 24 different spells ranging from magical arrows to fireballs, meteor storms, and even nuclear bombs. This variety creates unpredictable matches as players constantly exchange spells through successful hits. The core mechanic of spells returning to the caster forces players to think strategically about positioning and timing.

Players can customize matches with different modes (number of lives, timed games, team fights) and numerous modifiers. Modifiers can reduce spell cooldowns, make the world bouncy, change the art style, or trigger environmental hazards like violent thunderstorms. Multiple maps provide environmental variety.

The game supports local multiplayer and online play through Steam Remote Play Together. There is explicitly no solo mode - this is designed purely as a multiplayer experience.

## Fun Factor
Spell Swap delivers on its promise of chaotic wizard battles. The spell-swapping mechanic creates emergent gameplay moments where careful players suddenly find themselves wielding devastating spells, while aggressive players may end up with weaker abilities. The variety of modifiers and spells ensures that matches feel fresh and unpredictable. The frantic pace and colorful spell effects generate excitement and laughter.

## Player Count Experience
The game works with as few as 2 players but scales up to accommodate as many players as you have controllers. The 2D fighting game format means screens can get crowded with too many players, but smaller groups (2-6 players) create ideal competitive experiences. The lack of solo content means you absolutely need at least one other player to enjoy the game.

## Overall Reception

### Critic Scores
- Limited professional review coverage
- No major critic reviews available on Metacritic

### User Scores
- **Steam:** 91% Positive (24 user reviews) - "Very Positive"

### Key Takeaways
While Spell Swap hasn't received extensive professional coverage, the small pool of Steam users who have played it overwhelmingly recommend it with a 91% positive rating. The unique spell-swapping mechanic distinguishes it from other party fighting games, and the variety of modifiers provides considerable customization.

The lack of a single-player mode is a deliberate design choice but limits the game's appeal to only those who have regular access to multiplayer sessions. At $6.99, it's reasonably priced for what it offers, though it has been available for as low as $1.18 during sales, making it an excellent value proposition at discounted prices.

The game is best recommended for groups who enjoy fast-paced fighting games with unique mechanics and don't mind the requirement for local/Remote Play multiplayer. It's a solid choice for parties and gaming sessions with friends, particularly at sale prices.
