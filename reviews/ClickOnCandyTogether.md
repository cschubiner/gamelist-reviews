# Click on candy together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on candy together is a multiplayer hidden object game set in an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic scene featuring 100+ candies to discover. Players race to find and click candies, marking them in their chosen color before opponents can claim them.

Navigation through the panoramic artwork is accomplished by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or alternatively using keyboard controls (WASD, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) or gamepads. This multi-input support allows different players to use their preferred control method simultaneously.

When a player finds a candy, they click it to mark it as theirs, with the candy glowing in their selected color. A scoreboard displays who found what once all objects are discovered. The game features no time limit, prioritizing a relaxed, social atmosphere over timed pressure.

Color customization options are available in-game to reduce eye strain during extended play. The game supports multiple connection methods including local play, Steam Remote Play, LAN over WiFi, and experimental online play that doesn't require port forwarding.

The sweet, candy-themed artwork likely appeals to players who enjoy colorful, cheerful aesthetics while searching for hidden objects.

## Fun Factor

Click on candy together offers a lighthearted, stress-free competitive experience perfect for casual gaming sessions. The candy theme creates a colorful, appealing visual environment that's more whimsical than some of the other entries in the franchise.

The competitive element is gentle - players race to find candies but without time pressure, allowing for conversation and social interaction during play. The 100+ hidden objects provide substantial gameplay without becoming tedious, and the detailed artwork rewards careful observation.

The game is accessible to players of all ages and gaming experience levels. Finding hidden objects is intuitive and doesn't require complex mechanics or gaming knowledge, making it ideal for mixed groups including non-gamers or children.

## Player Count Experience

Click on candy together supports unlimited players, constrained only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) ensures flexibility for different group sizes and configurations.

The shared-screen format creates a communal experience where all players view the same scene simultaneously. This enables real-time reactions, friendly competition, and social bonding as players search together. The color-coded marking system provides immediate visual feedback on everyone's progress.

The game scales well across player counts. Solo play offers a peaceful hidden object experience, small groups can engage in focused competition, and larger gatherings create livelier, faster-paced searches. The unlimited player support makes it suitable for parties and family gatherings of any size.

Click on candy together is part of the "Click on things together" franchise, which features numerous themed variations sharing the same core hidden object gameplay. The candy theme is likely to appeal to players seeking more cheerful, colorful aesthetics compared to themes like spanners or staplers.

The frequent and substantial sales (up to 51% off) suggest an indie pricing strategy focused on accessibility and impulse purchases. The game caters to a niche audience of hidden object enthusiasts and casual multiplayer gamers rather than mainstream audiences.

Specific detailed reviews weren't extensively available in search results, indicating these are smaller indie titles. However, the continued expansion of the franchise suggests there's a dedicated audience enjoying these relaxed, artistic multiplayer experiences.
