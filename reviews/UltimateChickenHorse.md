# Ultimate Chicken Horse

## Game Overview
Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer game developed by Clever Endeavour Games where players build the level together while trying to reach the end. The unique twist: you want to build a level that only you can complete while ensuring others fail. Players place traps, blocks, and hazards to create challenging obstacle courses, then race to complete them before their friends.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Build-and-play platformer with level creation
- Players take turns placing obstacles and platforms
- Race to complete the level you collectively built
- Score points for reaching the goal while others fail
- Strategic placement of helpful and harmful objects
- Various characters with identical abilities (cosmetic differences)
- Multiple game modes and customization options
- Level editor for creating custom challenges
- Physics-based platforming
- Party game structure with rounds

## Fun Factor
Ultimate Chicken Horse delivers exceptional party game experiences through its brilliant build-compete-laugh cycle. The genius is in the tension between helping yourself and sabotaging others - you need the level to be possible for you but impossible for friends. This creates hilarious scenarios where overly-aggressive trap placement backfires. Watching friends fail spectacularly on obstacles you placed generates consistent laughter, while narrowly completing a chaotic course feels triumphant. The game perfectly balances strategy and chaos. However, it shines brightest in local multiplayer and loses much appeal in solo Challenge mode. A must-have for platformer-loving friend groups.
