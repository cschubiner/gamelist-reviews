# Mount Your Friends - Review Summary

Based on reviews from 5 sources, here's a comprehensive analysis of "Mount Your Friends":

---

## Gameplay

**Core Mechanic:** Mount Your Friends is a physics-based competitive climbing game where players take turns climbing a tower made of previous climbers (and a goat). Each player must reach higher than the previous climber before time runs out. The goal is to become the highest point on the ever-growing human tower.

**Game Modes:** Beyond the standard climbing mode, the game offers:
- Battle mode with a sword strapped to your head where you fling yourself at opponents
- Rock climbing mode where you climb as far as possible
- Capture the flag mode

Critics describe the gameplay design as surprisingly elegant, with the game conveying its mechanics clearly despite the absurdist premise.

## Mechanics

**Controls:** Players control each limb individually using separate buttons/inputs, making coordination "ridiculously difficult." You use controls to move each arm and leg independently and stick them to the floor, the goat, or other stacked players. The mechanic is described as "simple to get into, but difficult to master."

**Platform Translation:** Reviews note that controls translated well to PC, with mouse/keyboard implementations working effectively for limb manipulation, though Hardcore Gamer cited "spotty keyboard control implementation" as a minor weakness.

**Physics:** The game relies heavily on physics simulation, making each climb unpredictable and challenging.

## Fun Factor

**Humor & Novelty:** Reviews consistently praise the game's absurdist humor and "hilariously dangly" NSFW character design. MLGG notes that "curiosity about its ever so slightly NSFW content is repaid with a surprisingly compelling and genuinely fun experience." The randomly generated names and character appearances add to the replay value.

**Longevity Concerns:** Critics are divided on lasting appeal:
- **Positive view:** "Despite its simplicity, Mount Your Friends offers enough content to keep you playing for hours, especially in company of friends"
- **Negative view:** Riot Pixels gave it 20/100, stating it's "fun for the first 15 minutes" but lacks variety afterward

**Sound Design:** MLGG specifically praised the "phenomenal" soundtrack and "melodramatic" grunts and groans that enhance the comedic atmosphere.

## Player Count Experience

**Multiplayer Focus:** All reviews emphasize that Mount Your Friends is fundamentally a multiplayer/party game:
- Supports **local play with up to 4 players**
- Hot seat multiplayer is described as the "core strength"
- Multiple reviewers note they "never laughed so hard first time playing it"
- MOUSE n JOYPAD states: "This game is built not to be played with a stranger over the Intrawebs, but with a pal"

**Social Experience:** Reviews highlight that onlookers become invested in each player's performance, creating exciting competitive moments in groups.

**Solo Play:** Limited appeal for single-player - critics note it "wouldn't be much fun alone" and emphasize it's best suited for party situations rather than solo gaming.

**Online Multiplayer:** Available but reviewers note "limited online play" and recommend it primarily as a local experience.
