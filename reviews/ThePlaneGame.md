# The Plane Game

## Gameplay & Mechanics

The Plane Game is a unique team-based multiplayer game that supports an impressive 2-24 players in couch co-op mode, making it the only game on Steam that can accommodate up to 24 players locally. The game features simultaneous turn-based gameplay where players split into teams of 1-6 people and work together to achieve victory.

Each player controls their jet using their phone as a controller, while the game board is displayed on a large screen TV, creating a shared viewing experience. The primary objective is to sink all enemy carriers or jets through strategic gameplay and teamwork. Teams must coordinate their moves and attacks effectively to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents.

The phone-as-controller system eliminates the need for expensive gaming peripherals and makes it easy for large groups to participate without technical barriers. The game board provides a clear overview of the battlefield, allowing teams to strategize and execute coordinated attacks.

## Fun Factor

The Plane Game's standout feature is its exceptional scalability for local multiplayer. Very few games can genuinely support 24 simultaneous players in the same room, making it perfect for large parties, gaming events, or family gatherings. The team-based structure encourages collaboration and social interaction, which is the heart of couch co-op gaming.

According to community feedback, the game becomes progressively more fun as the group size increases. The simultaneous turn-based system keeps all players engaged without long wait times, which is crucial when managing large player counts. The strategic depth of coordinating team attacks and defending positions provides enough complexity to keep games interesting across multiple sessions.

## Player Count Experience

The Plane Game is specifically designed for couch co-op multiplayer and can accommodate anywhere from 2 to 24 players. Teams can be configured from 1 to 6 players each, allowing for various competitive formats (e.g., 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or asymmetric matchups like 4v2).

The game truly shines with larger groups, where the social dynamics and team coordination become more complex and engaging. With smaller groups, the game is still functional but may not showcase its unique strengths as effectively as it does with 8+ players. This scalability makes it ideal for events where player counts might vary or grow throughout the evening.

## Overall Reception

**Steam Rating:** Positive community reception noted in reviews

**Price:** Not specified in search results

**Platform:** Steam (PC), specifically designed for couch co-op with shared screen

Community reviews emphasize that the game's enjoyment scales with group size, with larger gatherings providing the best experience. Players appreciate the unique 24-player local support, which fills a significant gap in the party gaming market. Most multiplayer games supporting 8+ players focus on PvP party modes, making The Plane Game's cooperative team-based approach relatively rare.

The primary criticism noted concerns the UI design, with some players mentioning limitations when playing with multiple controllers. However, this doesn't appear to significantly impact the overall enjoyment for most players.
