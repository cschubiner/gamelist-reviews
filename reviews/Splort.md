# Splort

## Overview
Splort is an intense physics-based party brawler featuring unique elastic hand mechanics and force-based combat. Released on March 12, 2025, the game supports 2-12 players and combines climbing, pushing, and weapon handling in a chaotic environment where anything can be lethal. With 170+ levels and 50+ weapons, Splort offers substantial content for party gaming sessions.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Splort features completely novel mechanics that set it apart from traditional party brawlers. The game is often described as what would happen if Stick Fight, Duck Game, and Getting Over It had a "mutated love child."

**Core Controls:**
- **Elastic Hand:** Control your character using a stretchy hand to climb, push opponents, and handle weapons
- **Leg Movement:** Move legs up and down to jump and stomp on enemies
- **Physics-Based Danger:** Anything hitting you hard enough can kill, crush your legs, or snap your head off

**Learning Curve:**
Controls are easy to learn but challenging to master. Players will stumble around clumsily at first, but the simple inputs allow for quick learning while providing a high skill ceiling for dedicated players.

**Content:**
- **170+ Levels:** Each level provides unique opportunities for creative play
- **50+ Weapons:** All physics-based with distinct properties
- **Multiple Game Modes:** Classic modes (Free-For-All, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag) plus unique variations with kings and balls

The physics-based weapons and environments create emergent gameplay where player creativity and skill are rewarded. The elastic hand mechanic allows for both offensive and defensive play, from flinging opponents to clutching edges to avoid falls.

## Fun Factor
Splort delivers intense, chaotic entertainment perfect for party settings. The unique control scheme creates inherently funny moments as players fumble with their elastic hands while trying to execute their strategies. Reviewers emphasize that Splort is "incredibly fun to both play and watch," making it excellent for party environments where spectators can enjoy the spectacle.

The game promises "memorable moments, strong reactions, and a high skill ceiling waiting to be conquered." The combination of simple controls and physics-based chaos means both newcomers and skilled players can find enjoyment, though experienced players can dominate through superior technique.

The massive variety of weapons (50+) and levels (170+) ensures substantial replay value as players discover new strategies and interactions.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** 2-12 players (recommended), with support for as many as you can connect controllers

**Multiplayer Options:**
- **Local Multiplayer:** 2-12 players using connected controllers
- **Steam Remote Play:** Up to 4 players remotely

**Scalability:**
- **2-4 Players:** Tactical, focused combat
- **5-8 Players:** Balanced chaos and strategy
- **9-12 Players:** Maximum chaos with screen-filling mayhem

The generous player count support (up to 12 recommended, potentially more) makes Splort particularly valuable for large gatherings. The game modes accommodate various group sizes, from intimate duels to massive free-for-alls.

## Overall Reception

**Status:** Recently released (March 12, 2025)
**Reception:** Limited reviews due to recent release, but described as incredibly fun

As a brand new release, Splort hasn't accumulated substantial reviews yet. However, the marketing and early descriptions emphasize:
- Incredibly fun to play and watch
- Novel mechanics unlike other games
- High skill ceiling
- Memorable moments and strong reactions

The comparison to established games like Stick Fight and Duck Game suggests it targets fans of physics-based party brawlers while offering unique mechanics through the elastic hand system.

### Strengths
- Unique elastic hand control mechanics
- 170+ levels for variety
- 50+ physics-based weapons
- Supports 2-12+ players
- Steam Remote Play for online groups
- High skill ceiling
- Multiple game modes (FFA, TDM, CTF, plus unique variants)
- Fun to watch as spectator
- Easy to learn basics
- Emergent physics-based gameplay
- Available on Windows and Mac

### Weaknesses
- Very new release with limited community feedback
- Clumsy controls may frustrate some initially
- Physics-based gameplay can feel random
- May require large groups to fully appreciate
- Limited online play (Steam Remote Play only supports 4)
- Too new to assess long-term community

### Who Should Play
Splort is perfect for:
- Party game enthusiasts seeking unique mechanics
- Fans of Stick Fight, Duck Game, Gang Beasts
- Groups that enjoy physics-based chaos
- Players who appreciate high skill ceilings
- Large gaming gatherings (8-12 players ideal)
- Streamers looking for entertaining content
- Those who enjoy Getting Over It-style controls

The game works best with groups who can laugh at the inherent clumsiness of the control scheme while appreciating the skill expression it allows. Local multiplayer with many controllers is the ideal scenario.

Not recommended for players seeking precise, responsive controls or those who get frustrated by physics-based unpredictability. The learning curve for the elastic hand mechanics may turn off players expecting traditional fighting game controls.
