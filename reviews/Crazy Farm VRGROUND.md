## Important Notice

**GAME NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL:** The developers ended game service in October 2024, with servers shutting down on Friday, October 25, 2024. This game is no longer playable and should not be purchased. This review is provided for archival purposes only.

## Gameplay & Mechanics (Historical)

Crazy Farm: VRGROUND was an asymmetric multiplayer party game based on a clash between a farmer (using VR headset or PC) and animals (using smart devices) who attempted to steal the farmer's apples. The game supported up to 11 simultaneous players, with AI filling in for missing players if the full complement wasn't available.

**Player Roles:**
- **1 Farmer:** Used VR headset or PC to defend their farm and apples
- **Up to 10 Animals:** Used smartphones/tablets to coordinate stealing apples

**Game Modes:**
The game featured 3 different game modes, though specific details about these modes are limited in available documentation.

**Accessibility:**
The hybrid VR/PC farmer option meant the game could be played without VR equipment, though the VR experience was the intended primary farmer experience. Mobile players needed smartphones or tablets to participate as animals.

## Fun Factor (Historical Assessment)

As an asymmetric VR party game, Crazy Farm: VRGROUND attempted to create entertaining experiences where one VR player faced off against a group of smartphone users. The farmer vs. animals theme provided a lighthearted, accessible concept that could appeal to diverse age groups.

However, extremely limited review data (only 7 user reviews) and lack of substantial community feedback suggest the game struggled to build a significant player base during its operational period.

## Player Count Experience (Historical)

**Supported:** 1-11 players (1 VR/PC + 1-10 mobile)
**AI Support:** Could fill missing player slots

The scalability from 2 to 11 players with AI support offered flexibility for different group sizes. However, as with most asymmetric VR party games, the experience likely depended heavily on having multiple human players rather than AI opponents.

## Technical Considerations

**Development Status:** Development ceased over 6 years before server shutdown
**Last Update:** Over 6 years ago (as of October 2024)
**Server Status:** Permanently offline as of October 25, 2024

The game received no updates for over 6 years before its servers were shut down, indicating it was effectively abandoned long before official service termination. This lack of ongoing support likely contributed to its failure to maintain a player community.

## Overall Reception

**Steam User Score:** Not enough reviews to generate score (only 7 reviews)
**Critical Reception:** Virtually no professional coverage
**Community Engagement:** Minimal
**Metacritic:** No score due to insufficient reviews

### Historical Strengths:
- Asymmetric VR + mobile gameplay concept
- Support for up to 11 players
- AI could fill missing player slots
- PC option available (didn't require VR)
- Accessible farm theme

### Historical Weaknesses:
- Extremely limited player base
- Development ceased 6+ years before shutdown
- Only 7 user reviews indicates low interest
- No professional review coverage
- Now permanently unplayable (servers shut down)
- Early Access game that never reached full release

## Verdict

**GAME IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE OR FUNCTIONAL**

Crazy Farm: VRGROUND represents a failed experiment in asymmetric VR party gaming. Despite launching in 2018 during VR's growing popularity, the game failed to attract a meaningful player base, evidenced by only 7 Steam reviews and abandonment by developers years before final server shutdown.

The concept of farmer vs. animals in an asymmetric VR environment had potential appeal, but poor execution, lack of ongoing development, or insufficient marketing prevented it from gaining traction in a competitive party game market.

**Current Status:** Not recommended - game is permanently offline and unplayable as of October 25, 2024.

**Historical Context:** Even before shutdown, the game showed warning signs (6+ years without updates, minimal reviews) that should have deterred potential purchases. The server shutdown confirms this was a failed project.

**For Researchers/Archivists:** This title serves as a case study in the risks of live-service party games, particularly in niche categories like VR asymmetric multiplayer. Without sustained development and community building, such games can become entirely unplayable when servers shut down.
