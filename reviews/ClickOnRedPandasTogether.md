# Click on red pandas together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on red pandas together is a multiplayer hidden object game set in an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic environment featuring 100+ red pandas to discover. Players compete to locate and click red pandas, marking them in their chosen color before other players can claim them.

Players navigate the panoramic scene by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or using alternative controls including keyboard (WASD + E, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) or gamepads. This flexibility allows multiple players to use different input methods simultaneously based on their preferences.

Each player selects a color at the beginning, and when they find and click a red panda, it glows in their chosen color. A scoreboard displays who found what once all objects are discovered. The achievement system grants milestones for finding the first object, reaching halfway, and discovering the last few red pandas.

The game features customizable color themes that can be adjusted in-game to reduce eye strain and accommodate "tired eyes," along with optional relaxing music that can be disabled if preferred. These accessibility features show consideration for player comfort during extended sessions.

Connectivity options include local play, Steam Remote Play, LAN over WiFi, and experimental connectionless online play that doesn't require port forwarding. There's no time limit, creating a relaxed competitive atmosphere.

## Fun Factor

Click on red pandas together offers an adorable, charming search experience. The red panda theme is particularly appealing, as these animals are widely beloved for their cuteness and distinctive appearance. The hand-drawn artwork likely captures their charm while providing visual richness that makes exploration enjoyable.

The competitive element is gentle - players race to find red pandas but without time pressure, allowing for social interaction and conversation during play. The achievement milestones create natural moments of excitement and accomplishment throughout the search.

The 100+ hidden objects provide substantial gameplay without becoming overwhelming. The relaxing music option enhances the calming atmosphere, making it suitable for unwinding while still engaging in friendly competition. The color customization and music toggle show attention to player preferences and accessibility.

## Player Count Experience

Click on red pandas together supports unlimited players, constrained only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) ensures flexibility for different group configurations.

The shared-screen format creates a communal experience where all players view the same scene simultaneously. This enables real-time reactions, shared excitement over particularly cute or well-hidden pandas, and friendly competition. The color-coded marking system provides immediate visual feedback on everyone's progress.

The game scales effectively across player counts. Solo players can enjoy a peaceful, meditative search, pairs engage in friendly competition, and larger groups create more dynamic, fast-paced searches. The unlimited player support makes it suitable for gatherings and parties of any size.
