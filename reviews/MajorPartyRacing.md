# Major Party Racing

## Overview
Major Party Racing is a unique party racing game that flips the traditional racing formula - instead of actively driving, players configure their vehicles once before the race, then watch as their setups compete autonomously. Currently in Early Access, the game offers both a free "Core" version and a paid full version, combining unpredictable racing with idle mechanics and social wagering.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Major Party Racing delivers an innovative take on racing games by removing direct control during races, creating a spectator-focused social experience.

**Core Concept:**
Players don't actively drive during races. Instead, they pre-configure their vehicles with various customization options, then watch the race unfold based on their setup choices.

**Team Structure:**
- **Racers vs. Support Teams:** Players split into two squads
- **4 Support Teams:** Each locked to a specific driver
- **1 Lone VIP Driver:** Acts as their own support team

**Vehicle Customization:**
- **5×5×5×5×5 Options:** Over 3,000 different customization combinations
- **Unique Behaviors:** Each configuration creates completely different vehicle performance
- **Pre-Race Strategy:** All setup happens before the race starts

**Social Wagering:**
Support teams place "big goals" on their chosen driver - what happens if their pilot wins:
- Ordering pizza
- Calling for the jacuzzi
- Requesting a dance-off
- Hilarious video challenges
- Custom wagers and dares

**Design Philosophy:**
"A party is about spending time with friends, not getting lost in a screen" - the game enhances social interaction rather than replacing it with screen focus.

## Fun Factor
Major Party Racing creates entertainment through anticipation, surprise, and social interaction rather than twitch gameplay. The pre-race configuration phase involves strategic thinking and discussion, while the race itself becomes a spectator sport where everyone watches their setups compete.

The social wagering system adds real-world stakes and humor to the races. Watching your carefully configured vehicle compete while knowing your friend will have to perform a dance-off if they lose creates investment beyond digital outcomes.

The massive customization options (3,000+ combinations) mean races can feature wildly different vehicle behaviors, creating unpredictable and entertaining moments. The lack of active control removes skill barriers, making everyone equally invested regardless of gaming ability.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** Multiple players (specific count details limited, but supports team-based structure)

**Team Configuration:**
- 4 support team positions
- 5 total drivers (4 with dedicated support teams, 1 Lone VIP)
- Minimum: Approximately 5-9 players for full team experience

The game appears designed for medium to large groups where players can divide into meaningful team structures. The support team vs. racer dynamic creates role differentiation and strategic discussions.

**Social Format:**
The idle racing format means players can socialize, eat, drink, and interact normally during races without needing intense screen focus. This makes it ideal for actual parties where gaming is part of the experience but not the sole focus.

## Platforms
- PC (Steam)

## Pricing
- **Core Version:** Free
- **Full Version:** Paid (check Steam for Early Access pricing)

The free "Core" version allows players to try the concept before committing to the full experience, showing developer confidence in the unique gameplay.

## Overall Reception

**Status:** Early Access (both Core and Full versions)

Major Party Racing is currently in active development with limited review data available. The innovative concept of racing without driving is either brilliant or niche depending on player expectations.

The free Core version demonstrates the developers' willingness to let players experience the unique format before purchasing, which suggests confidence in the concept's appeal once understood.

### Strengths

- Eliminates skill barriers (everyone equal)
- Encourages actual social interaction
- Perfect for parties where gaming is secondary
- Strategic pre-race configuration phase
- Unpredictable racing creates entertainment

### Weaknesses
- Early Access with uncertain final form
- Very limited review data
- Concept may not appeal to traditional racing fans
- Lack of active control may frustrate some
- Requires right social group to appreciate
- May lack depth for serious gaming sessions
- Unknown content variety and replay value
- Team structure may require specific player counts

### Who Should Play
Major Party Racing is ideal for:
- Party hosts seeking unique social experiences
- Groups that want gaming alongside conversation
- Players tired of traditional racing games
- Friend groups that enjoy wagering and dares
- Large gatherings (8-10+ players ideal)
- Social gamers over competitive gamers
- People seeking low-skill-barrier entertainment
- Those who enjoy watching competition unfold

**Perfect Scenario:**
House parties, casual gatherings, or friend groups where everyone wants to participate but not everyone is a skilled gamer. The game facilitates social interaction rather than demanding screen attention.

**Not Recommended For:**
- Competitive racing game fans
- Players wanting active control
- Solo players or small groups (2-3)
- Those seeking deep mechanical gameplay
- Serious gaming sessions
- People who want traditional racing experiences

The free Core version makes this a no-risk experiment for curious groups. If the concept appeals, the full version offers expanded content.
