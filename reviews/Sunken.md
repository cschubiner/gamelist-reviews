# Sunken

## Overview
**Platform:** PC (Steam)
**Players:** Single-player and Co-op multiplayer
**Price:** Available on Steam (25% discount often available)
**Release Date:** Early Access
**Developer/Publisher:** Vector3 Studios

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Sunken (full title: Sunkenland) is a post-apocalyptic survival and exploration game often described as "Raft meets Rust in an underwater base-builder." Set in a near-future where water has covered most of Earth, players must survive the oceanic apocalypse by building underwater and floating bases, diving to explore sunken ruins, scavenging resources, and defending against pirates.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
- Dive to explore underwater environments and sunken structures
- Gather resources from the ocean floor and floating debris
- Build and expand bases both above and below water
- Defend against hostile pirates and AI threats
- Craft equipment and upgrades for deeper diving and better survival
- Navigate a vast open-world water environment

**Multiplayer Features:**
Players can cooperate with friends in PvE gameplay, working together to build bases, explore dangerous areas, and fight pirate threats. The game currently focuses on cooperative PvE rather than PvP, though servers can enable friendly fire for those seeking quasi-PvP experiences.

## Fun Factor

Sunkenland offers compelling survival gameplay with the unique twist of underwater exploration and aquatic base building. The combination of diving mechanics, resource gathering, and base construction creates an engaging gameplay loop. Fighting pirates and exploring sunken locations provide action-oriented excitement beyond pure survival mechanics.

However, the game's fun is significantly hampered by multiplayer technical issues. Many players report broken hosting capabilities where connection failures and crashes plague co-op sessions. For a game marketed partially on its cooperative features, these multiplayer problems substantially diminish the experience.

## Player Count Experience

**Optimal:** 2-4 players (co-op)
**Supported:** Single-player and co-op multiplayer (exact player count unclear)
**Current Mode:** PvE only (PvP not officially supported, though friendly fire can be enabled)

The game supports cooperative multiplayer for small groups, ideal for friends wanting to survive together. However, numerous reports indicate that multiplayer functionality is problematic - hosting issues prevent players from joining each other, and even Steam friends-only invites can crash players to desktop.

Single-player appears more stable, but this undermines the cooperative vision of surviving the apocalypse as a group. The community has called for significant server and multiplayer improvements, particularly to enable more reliable connections and potentially introduce proper PvP interactions.

## Technical Considerations

As an Early Access title, Sunkenland exhibits technical instability, particularly in multiplayer. Connection issues, hosting problems, and crashes significantly impact the cooperative experience. Single-player performance appears more reliable, though Early Access nature means bugs and performance issues should be expected.

The game's open-world aquatic environment may have higher system requirements than typical survival games due to water rendering and underwater visibility calculations.

## Overall Reception

**Steam User Score:** 84% Positive (8,565 reviews) - Very Positive
**Critical Reception:** Positive for Early Access, with recognition of potential
**Development Status:** Early Access with ongoing updates

### Strengths:
- Unique underwater survival setting
- Engaging combination of diving, exploration, and base building
- "Raft meets Rust" concept execution
- Strong potential for growth
- Very Positive overall Steam reviews
- Open-world aquatic exploration
- Cooperative PvE gameplay

### Weaknesses:
- Broken/problematic multiplayer functionality
- Hosting and connection issues prevent reliable co-op
- Early Access bugs and instability
- No official PvP support (only via friendly fire workaround)
- Requires significant multiplayer infrastructure improvements
- Technical issues crash players during co-op sessions

## Verdict

Sunkenland presents an ambitious and compelling vision of post-apocalyptic underwater survival, successfully merging elements from popular survival games into a unique aquatic setting. The core gameplay loop of diving, building, and surviving has strong potential, and the Very Positive Steam reviews suggest many players are enjoying the experience despite its Early Access status.

However, the game's multiplayer problems represent a critical flaw for a title that markets cooperative play as a key feature. Those purchasing primarily for co-op sessions should be aware of significant hosting and connection issues. Solo players or those willing to tolerate technical problems may find enough engaging content to justify an Early Access purchase, with the expectation that multiplayer improvements will come with continued development.

**Recommended for:** Survival game fans, underwater exploration enthusiasts, solo players, those willing to tolerate Early Access instability, "Raft" or "Rust" fans seeking new settings

**Not recommended for:** Players primarily seeking reliable co-op experiences, those frustrated by technical issues, gamers requiring PvP content, those expecting polished, bug-free experiences

**Note:** As an Early Access title, conditions may improve significantly with future updates addressing multiplayer infrastructure.
