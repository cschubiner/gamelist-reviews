# Ewephoria

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Ewephoria is an arcade-style party game where players take on the role of sheepdogs tasked with herding sheep to safety. The game goes well beyond simple sheep herding, featuring a diverse array of activities including avoiding cows, terrifying wolves, flying fighter jets, sailing ships, and playing cards - all within the context of this sheepherding universe.

The game is designed with multiplayer at its core, though most levels are also playable in single-player mode. Players use their phones as controllers by scanning an in-game QR code, creating an accessible control scheme that requires no app downloads. This phone-based system allows for an unlimited number of players, with the practical limit being the size of your living room.

Most levels are designed for cooperative play, encouraging teams of sheepdogs to work together to herd sheep in the fastest time possible. However, competitive elements exist through personal leaderboards where players can challenge each other to set high scores, as well as dedicated head-to-head levels where sheepdog teams directly compete.

The game includes three special relaxation modes where sheepdogs can compete in minigames: flying fighter jets, sailing ships, and playing cards against each other.

## Fun Factor

Ewephoria's charm lies in its absurd premise and variety of activities. The game takes a simple concept - herding sheep - and expands it into a wide range of engaging scenarios. The combination of cooperative herding challenges and competitive head-to-head modes provides different types of fun for various group dynamics.

The special minigames (fighter jets, sailing, and card playing) add delightful variety and serve as palette cleansers between herding sessions. The cooperative focus makes it excellent for team-building and working together, while the competitive leaderboards and head-to-head modes satisfy those who prefer direct competition.

The unlimited player support is a significant advantage, allowing groups to scale up without worrying about hitting player limits. The phone-as-controller system removes technical barriers and makes it easy for newcomers to join mid-session.

## Player Count Experience

Ewephoria truly stands out in its approach to player counts. With no hard upper limit on players (beyond physical space constraints), it's one of the most scalable party games available. Most levels support both single-player and multiplayer modes, with team-based cooperative gameplay being the primary design focus.

The game accommodates various group sizes effectively - small groups can enjoy the cooperative challenges and compete on leaderboards, while large gatherings can create multiple sheepdog teams for epic herding competitions. The head-to-head levels allow direct team versus team competition, adding structured competitive modes for those who want them.

The flexibility to switch between cooperative and competitive modes means the game can adapt to different group preferences and energy levels throughout a gaming session.
