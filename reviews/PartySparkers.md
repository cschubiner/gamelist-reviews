## Gameplay & Mechanics

PartySparkers is a three-in-one party game collection that uses smartphones as controllers. The package includes three distinct fully-fledged digital board games, each with unique mechanics and player counts:

**Bajillions (2-20 players):** A trivia game designed for people who don't like traditional trivia. Instead of answering questions with specific facts, players bet on numerical comparisons, such as whether there are more streetlights in the world or rats in New York City. This clever approach makes trivia accessible and entertaining for everyone, regardless of knowledge level.

**Unrealty (3-7 players):** An improv-based game where players take on the role of real estate agents selling fantastical houses to whimsical clients. Each property comes with crazy upsides and hilarious downsides, creating opportunities for creative pitches and entertaining debates among players.

**Little Stinkers (2-6 players):** A bluffing game that tests players' deception and deduction skills.

All three games use players' phones as controllers, eliminating the need for multiple physical controllers or complicated setup processes.

## Fun Factor

The variety offered by three distinct games in one package provides excellent value and replayability. Each game targets different social gaming preferences - competitive trivia, creative improvisation, and strategic bluffing - ensuring there's something for different moods and group dynamics.

The phone-as-controller system is particularly clever, as it means any gathering of friends can instantly start playing without worrying about having enough controllers. The games work equally well in person or online, making them versatile for different social situations.

Bajillions' approach to trivia is especially innovative, removing the intimidation factor that traditional trivia games can have while still providing competitive engagement. Unrealty taps into the creativity and humor of players, making it ideal for groups that enjoy improv and storytelling.

## Player Count Experience

PartySparkers excels at accommodating a wide range of group sizes. With Bajillions supporting up to 20 players, it's one of the few party games that can truly handle very large gatherings. The flexibility to switch between games means that as people arrive or leave, you can adjust to a different game mode that better suits the current player count.

The minimum player counts are reasonable (2-3 depending on the game), though games like Unrealty and Little Stinkers likely shine more with their higher player counts where social dynamics become more interesting.

While specific review scores weren't available in the search results, PartySparkers appears to be a well-designed party game collection that addresses common party gaming pain points. The phone-as-controller system and game variety are clear selling points that differentiate it from single-game party titles.

The ability to accommodate 2-20 players across different games makes it one of the more flexible party game options available on Steam.
