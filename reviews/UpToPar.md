# Up to Par

## Overview
Up to Par is a run-based roguelite minigolf game where players must stay under par or face elimination. Combining the precision of minigolf with roguelite progression and permadeath mechanics, the game offers both solo and multiplayer experiences supporting up to 16 players through procedurally generated levels.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Up to Par takes the familiar concept of minigolf and adds roguelite elements to create a unique hybrid experience. The core challenge is simple but demanding: stay under par or you're out. This creates constant pressure as players navigate through procedurally generated levels that ensure each run feels fresh.

**Key Features:**
- **Roguelite Progression:** Each run offers opportunities to unlock new content and upgrades
- **Procedural Levels:** Randomly generated courses keep the challenge unpredictable
- **Par-Based Elimination:** Missing par targets results in elimination, raising stakes on every shot
- **Run-Based Structure:** Complete runs offer sense of progression and achievement

The procedural generation means players can't simply memorize courses, requiring adaptability and skill rather than rote learning. The minigolf mechanics themselves emphasize precision and planning, with players needing to judge angles, power, and terrain carefully.

## Fun Factor
Up to Par succeeds at creating tension through its elimination mechanic. The pressure of needing to stay under par adds weight to every shot, transforming casual minigolf into a high-stakes challenge. The roguelite structure provides the "just one more run" addictiveness that keeps players returning.

The game balances accessibility with challenge - minigolf is universally understood, but the par requirement and procedural levels create genuine difficulty. Success feels earned, while failures motivate improvement and retry attempts.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** 1-16 players

Up to Par offers impressive scalability in player count:
- **Solo:** Full roguelite experience with progression systems
- **2-4 Players:** Intimate competitive or cooperative sessions
- **5-8 Players:** Lively group competition
- **9-16 Players:** Large party chaos with maximum competition

The 16-player support is notably high for a minigolf game, making it viable for large gatherings and events. The run-based structure works well for multiplayer as everyone experiences the same procedural challenges simultaneously, creating shared moments of triumph and frustration.

The elimination mechanic creates natural drama in multiplayer as players gradually drop out, with remaining competitors facing increasing pressure.
