# Click on ladybugs together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on ladybugs together is a competitive hidden object game set in an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic environment containing 100+ ladybugs. Players search the intricate artwork to find and click ladybugs, claiming them in their chosen color before opponents can.

Navigation is accomplished by clicking and dragging with the mouse to pan across the scene, then clicking discovered ladybugs to mark them. The game also supports keyboard controls (WASD, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) and gamepads, making it accessible for different player preferences and enabling multiple simultaneous input methods.

Color customization is available in-game to reduce eye strain during extended sessions. Each player selects a unique color at the start, and their found objects glow in that color, creating a visual scoreboard across the artwork itself.

Multiplayer connectivity options include local play with various input devices, Steam Remote Play for streaming to other devices, LAN connections over WiFi, and experimental online play that doesn't require port forwarding. The game features no time limit, creating a relaxed competitive atmosphere.

The achievement system grants milestones for finding the first object, reaching the halfway point, and discovering the final few ladybugs, providing structure and goals throughout the search.

## Fun Factor

The game offers a calming yet competitive experience, perfect for players who enjoy detailed artwork and observation challenges. The hand-drawn panoramic level provides visual richness that makes exploration enjoyable beyond just finding objects. The absence of time pressure allows for social interaction and conversation during play.

The competitive element adds engagement without creating stress - players race to find ladybugs but in a friendly, casual manner. The 100+ hidden objects ensure substantial playtime without feeling endless. The achievement milestones create natural moments of excitement and accomplishment throughout longer sessions.

The color-coded claiming system creates an evolving visual landscape as the artwork fills with different colored glows, providing immediate feedback on relative progress and creating a beautiful final result when all objects are found.

## Player Count Experience

Click on ladybugs together supports unlimited players, constrained only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) provides exceptional flexibility for different group configurations.

The shared-screen format where all players view the same scene simultaneously creates a communal experience. Players can celebrate each other's discoveries or groan when someone finds an object they were searching for. This social dynamic enhances the experience beyond simple competition.

The game scales well from solo relaxation sessions to large group competitions. Smaller groups can engage in focused competition, while larger gatherings create more chaotic but entertaining searches where objects disappear rapidly.
