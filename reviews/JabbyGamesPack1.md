# Jabby Games Pack 1

## Game Overview
Jabby Games Pack 1 is an AI-powered party game collection where your phone becomes the controller and an unpredictable AI joins as an extra player. The pack includes 6 unique games that blend traditional party game mechanics with AI-generated chaos, including drawing pictures, telling stories, solving crimes, and speed-dating digital characters, all with AI creating unexpected twists.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- 6 distinct games in one pack
- AI actively participates in gameplay
- Phone/tablet controllers via room code
- No app downloads required - browser-based
- Games include: Two Truths & AI, Story Recall, Love at First Byte, AI Said What?, AI See It, and more
- AI generates text, fake answers, stories, and personality responses
- Local multiplayer sessions with AI running on host computer
- Works for couch parties and streaming to remote friends

## Fun Factor
Jabby Games Pack 1 innovates by making AI an active, unpredictable participant rather than just a host. The AI's attempts to blend in with human answers create hilarious moments of confusion and surprise. Games like Two Truths & AI flip traditional formats by having AI generate fake answers alongside players. Story Recall and Love at First Byte showcase AI's creative (and sometimes bizarre) generation capabilities. The variety across 6 games means groups can find their favorites. Best for tech-savvy groups who enjoy the novelty of human vs AI gameplay and aren't bothered by occasional AI weirdness.
