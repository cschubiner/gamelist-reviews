# It's Quiz Time Review

## Overview
It's Quiz Time is a massive trivia game that bills itself as the biggest trivia game ever released on console and PC. Developed by a team largely composed of ex-Buzz! developers (the beloved PS2-era quiz game series), it features an AI host named Salli and boasts over 25,000 questions covering a vast range of topics.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Up to 8 players simultaneously compete using their smartphones as controllers, answering trivia questions across thousands of categories ranging from cartoons to video games, sports, and history.

The game features multiple game modes that vary the standard quiz format:
- **Traditional Trivia:** Standard question-and-answer rounds
- **Guesstimation:** Players estimate dates, numbers, or statistics
- **Description Matching:** Describing topics and matching all descriptors
- **Prediction Mode:** Betting on whether friends will answer questions correctly

Salli, the AI-technology game host, presents questions and keeps the energy high throughout gameplay sessions.

## Fun Factor
The variety in game modes prevents the experience from becoming stale, and the sheer volume of 25,000+ questions means you're unlikely to see repeats even after many sessions. The ex-Buzz! developer pedigree shows in the game's polish and understanding of what makes trivia games engaging.

The prediction mode adds a social element beyond just knowing facts, as players must consider their friends' knowledge and personalities when making bets.

## Player Count Experience
- **Local Players:** Up to 8 players using smartphones
- **Streaming Mode:** Up to 10,000 viewers can participate via Twitch, YouTube, or Mixer
