# The Gif Game

## Game Overview
The Gif Game is a multiplayer party game where players write prompts, submit GIFs that match those prompts, and vote for other players' GIFs in a battle for the funniest, most creative, or most on-point submissions. Using phones as controllers, players compete in real-time to top the scoreboard through wit and GIF selection skills.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Players write custom prompts for others to match
- Search and select GIFs from a massive library
- Vote on which GIFs best match the prompts
- Real-time gameplay keeps energy and pacing high
- Phone/tablet controllers for all players
- Scoring system rewards creativity and humor
- Multiple rounds with rotating prompt writers
- Everything happens simultaneously for fast-paced fun

## Fun Factor
The Gif Game taps into modern internet culture and meme humor, making it instantly relatable for most players. The joy comes from finding the perfect (or hilariously imperfect) GIF to match a prompt. Writing prompts gives players creative control, while GIF selection lets even less creative players shine by choosing well. The voting phase creates anticipation and laughter as surprising submissions are revealed. Works best with groups who are chronically online and appreciate GIF humor. The real-time nature prevents downtime and keeps everyone engaged.
