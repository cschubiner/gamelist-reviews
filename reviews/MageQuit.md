## Gameplay

**Core Mechanics:**
- Top-down wizard brawler supporting 2-10 players (online or local)
- Nine rounds of battle royale-style combat
- Matches are fast-paced with individual encounters lasting under 30 seconds
- Players compete to accumulate the highest score and grow the longest beard (beards grow with each kill)

**What Critics Say:**
- Screen Rant praised the combat as "surprisingly tactical," requiring players to defend against various attack types and predict opponent spell trajectories
- TheGamer compared individual rounds to "Mario Party mini-games" where players balance aggressive combat with defensive positioning
- TheXboxHub noted that environmental hazards (like a "terrifying fish" that eats players) add humor and chaos to matches

## Mechanics

**Spell Drafting System:**
The unanimous standout feature is the dynamic spell progression system:

- Players start each match with one spell chosen from a random pool
- After each round, players select a new spell from a different random assortment
- Seven different elemental spell types provide variety
- The system creates a "multiplayer roguelike" experience with escalating challenge

**Critical Consensus:**
- **Screen Rant** called it "ingenious," praising how it builds out mage abilities one-at-a-time
- **TheXboxHub** highlighted the MOBA-like spell system as creating significant replayability
- The game balances fairness by distributing powerful abilities based on kill count, giving struggling players competitive opportunities

**Major Criticism - Controls:**
- **Screen Rant** noted keyboard and mouse controls are "bafflingly arcane," putting PC players without gamepads at a significant disadvantage
- **TheGamer** criticized "the schizophrenic nature of the ever-remapped controls and slow, clunky, almost awkward movement of the wizards"
- However, **TheXboxHub** found "the controls are simple to get a hold of" with gamepad

## Fun Factor

**Strengths:**
- **Windows Central**: "One of the best party games since Overcooked" when playing against friends on the couch
- **TheXboxHub**: Creates "a delightful cacophony of chaos" and helps players "feel immediately more comfortable" due to its lighthearted approach
- **Screen Rant**: Praised the "charming art style" and noted it works well for both casual and skilled players
- Fast matchmaking with accurate wait time estimates
- No microtransactions

**Limitations:**
- **TheGamer**: "Things get a little too chaotic toward the end" with potential confusion about spell assignments
- **TheXboxHub**: "The game just can't shake the feeling that there isn't enough there" - limited content for long-term engagement
- **TheGamer**: Only 12-15 arenas means repetition sets in quickly during extended sessions
- Cosmetic leveling system feels disconnected from the simple art style

## Player Count Experience

**Optimal Experience:**
- All reviewers agreed the game shines brightest as a local couch co-op/party game
- **Windows Central** emphasized you can "share it with just about anyone"
- **TheXboxHub**: "I greatly preferred the experience when playing with others on my couch. It's a great way to have fun with anyone who has an interest in games"

**Online Player Count Reality:**
- Despite positive reviews, Steam Charts show very low concurrent players (17-23 currently)
- All-time peak was only 220 concurrent players
- This presents challenges for finding online matches despite fast matchmaking when players are available

**Scalability:**
- Supports 2-10 players
- Works for both online and local play
- Multiple unique stages with environmental hazards provide variety

**Final Verdicts:**
