**Players:** 3-10 players (smartphone + PC/TV)
**Price:** Listed on Steam (Coming Soon status on some regions)
**Release Date:** Available but with limited platform support
**Developer/Publisher:** Buzzito LLC

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Selfie Games is a collection of group party games that transforms players into the stars of the show by incorporating their selfies and creativity into hilarious party game experiences. The game uses a hybrid control scheme where 3-10 players use their smartphones or tablets as controllers (via mobile app or web browser) while all the action and results display on a computer or TV screen.

**Primary Game - Sketchies:**
The flagship game in the collection follows a creative drawing and guessing format:
1. Players snap selfies using their phone cameras
2. Draw absurd pictures featuring friends' faces
3. Write hilarious fake captions for the drawings
4. Guess which captions are real and which are fake

**Scoring System:**
Players earn points by correctly guessing authentic captions and by successfully fooling friends into choosing their fake captions. This creates a mix of creativity, humor, and deception that drives engagement.

**Technical Setup:**
Players connect by visiting a website or using a mobile app, with no downloads required for web-based participation. This accessibility lowers barriers to entry for casual party gaming.

## Fun Factor

Reviews describe Selfie Games as "quirky and fun," with Gizmodo praising the visuals and sounds as "spot on." The selfie-integration mechanic creates personalized humor as players see their own and their friends' faces incorporated into ridiculous scenarios. The drawing and caption-writing elements allow for creative expression and comedic moments that emerge organically from the group's dynamic.

However, the game's availability issues significantly impact its viability. Being delisted from most mobile platforms (Microsoft Store, Amazon, Google Play, Apple App Store) while showing "coming soon" status on Steam suggests ongoing development or platform challenges that may affect the player experience.

## Player Count Experience

**Optimal:** 5-8 players
**Supported:** 3-10 players
**Solo Play:** Not applicable (requires minimum 3 players)

The game is specifically designed for medium to large groups, with the 3-player minimum ensuring enough participants for drawing, guessing, and deception mechanics to work effectively. The 10-player maximum keeps sessions manageable while still allowing for substantial group participation.

The smartphone controller approach makes it highly accessible for casual groups since most attendees will already have compatible devices. However, the delisting from major app stores may complicate the connection process for mobile users.

## Technical Considerations

The hybrid smartphone + TV/PC architecture creates potential technical complications:
- Requires stable local network for phone-to-PC communication
- Players need web browsers or specific apps to connect
- Delisting from major mobile app stores limits access options
- Steam version shows "coming soon" in some regions, suggesting platform availability issues

The web-based connection option provides a fallback for app store access problems, but overall platform instability is concerning.

## Overall Reception

**Steam User Score:** Described as "very fun" by community members
**Critical Reception:** Positive mentions from Gizmodo and limited review sources
**Platform Status:** Problematic - delisted from multiple major stores

- Innovative selfie-integration gameplay
- Supports 3-10 players for flexible group sizes
- Easy smartphone controller access (via web or app)

## Verdict

Selfie Games [TV] offers an entertaining concept that successfully merges smartphone accessibility with party game humor through selfie integration. The drawing and caption-guessing gameplay creates moments of creativity and laughter perfect for social gatherings. When working properly, the game delivers on its promise of opening up gaming fun for diverse groups.

However, significant platform availability concerns cannot be ignored. The game's delisting from Microsoft Store, Amazon, Google Play, and Apple App Store, combined with "coming soon" status on Steam in some regions, suggests ongoing development challenges or business issues that may impact long-term viability and support.

**Recommendation Status:** Conditional - proceed with caution

**Recommended for:** Groups willing to troubleshoot platform issues, fans of Jackbox-style party games, those with technical troubleshooting capabilities, groups seeking selfie-based humor

**Not recommended for:** Those requiring polished, stable platform support; groups without technical troubleshooting skills; anyone uncomfortable with selfie-based gameplay

**Important Note:** Potential buyers should verify current platform availability and functionality before purchase, as the delisting from major app stores may significantly impact usability.
