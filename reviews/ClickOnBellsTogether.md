# Click on bells together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on bells together is a hidden object search game featuring an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic scene containing 100+ bells scattered throughout. Players compete to locate and click bells, claiming them in their selected color before other players can find them.

Players navigate the panoramic artwork by clicking and dragging with the mouse or using alternative controls including arrow keys or gamepads. When a bell is discovered, clicking it marks it with the player's chosen color and adds it to their score. The game tracks who found what through a scoreboard displayed once all objects are found.

Each player selects a color at the beginning, and discovered bells glow in that player's color, creating a visual representation of everyone's progress across the artwork. In-game color themes can be customized to reduce eye strain, showing consideration for extended play sessions.

The game supports multiple connectivity methods: local play with mouse/keyboard/gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN over WiFi, and experimental online play. There's no time limit, creating a relaxed competitive environment where players can search at their own pace.

## Fun Factor

Click on bells together offers a zen-like competitive experience that balances relaxation with friendly rivalry. The detailed hand-drawn artwork makes the search itself visually engaging, rewarding close examination and pattern recognition. The absence of time pressure prevents frustration and allows for social interaction during play.

The 100+ hidden bells provide substantial content for extended sessions without feeling overwhelming. The "Hard" difficulty rating suggests the bells are well-hidden and require careful observation, creating satisfying "aha!" moments when particularly tricky objects are spotted.

The gentle competition works well for mixed groups with varying gaming experience - finding hidden objects is an intuitive activity that doesn't require complex controls or gaming knowledge. The customizable color themes help maintain visual comfort during longer searches.

## Player Count Experience

Click on bells together supports unlimited players, limited only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, keyboard with multiple layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) ensures most group configurations can participate.

The shared-screen format creates a communal atmosphere where all players view the same scene. This enables social interactions, friendly banter, and shared excitement when difficult objects are found. Players can see each other's progress in real-time through the color-coded marking system.

The game scales effectively across player counts. Solo players can enjoy a meditative search experience, pairs can engage in friendly one-on-one competition, and larger groups create more dynamic races where objects are claimed rapidly. The unlimited player support makes it suitable for parties and gatherings of various sizes.

Click on bells together is part of the "Click on things together" franchise, offering the same core gameplay with different themes and artwork. The "Hard" difficulty designation distinguishes it from some other entries in the series, potentially appealing to players seeking more challenging hidden object gameplay.

The game's presence in a larger franchise suggests modest success with its target audience of hidden object enthusiasts and casual multiplayer gamers. The frequent sales indicate an indie pricing model focused on accessibility and value.

Specific detailed reviews weren't extensively available in search results, suggesting these are niche titles catering to a specific audience rather than mainstream releases. The games serve players seeking low-stress, artistic, and socially oriented multiplayer experiences.
