## Overview
Horror Movie Bingo generates a bingo card for each person watching a horror movie. Instead of numbers, each space contains a horror movie trope (like "teenagers making bad decisions," "someone investigates a strange noise alone," or "the power goes out"). Your goal is to be the first player to notice enough tropes to fill 5-in-a-row while watching.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game is simple to use and easy to get into. Players can use phones, tablets, or laptops to access their individual bingo cards. The game even works over Zoom, making it perfect for virtual movie nights when everyone can't be in the same space.

In a single game, all players have the same 24 spaces on their bingo card, ensuring fair competition. If you play again with a different movie, you might get a different set of 24 tropes to watch for. Players mark off spaces as they spot the corresponding tropes during the movie, calling "Bingo!" when they complete a line.

The developer has actively updated the game to improve functionality, fixing issues to support all monitors (previously only 1080p monitors worked properly). The game is designed for casual play with friends and family, with features geared toward playing with people you trust.

## Fun Factor
Horror Movie Bingo transforms passive movie watching into an interactive competitive experience. It encourages viewers to pay closer attention to horror movie conventions and creates shared moments of recognition when a trope appears. The game works particularly well with "bad" horror movies that heavily rely on clichés, making B-movie marathons more entertaining.

The social aspect enhances both the movie and the game - calling out tropes and racing to mark them first adds energy to watch parties. It's especially fun for horror fans who enjoy recognizing and mocking genre conventions.

## Player Count Experience
Unlimited players can participate, with each person getting their own card on their device. This makes it perfect for parties of any size, from intimate two-person movie nights to large gatherings. The simultaneous gameplay means everyone stays engaged throughout the entire film, unlike traditional party games that require taking turns.

- Positive reception from users who have tried it

### Key Takeaways
Horror Movie Bingo occupies a unique niche as an enhancement to horror movie watching rather than a standalone party game. At $5.00, it's reasonably priced for groups who frequently watch horror movies together. The developer's commitment to fixing technical issues (like monitor resolution problems) shows ongoing support.

The game is best suited for:
- Horror movie enthusiasts who watch films regularly with friends
- Halloween party hosts looking for themed activities
- Bad movie night organizers who want to add interactivity
- Remote friend groups doing virtual movie nights

The requirement to actually watch a horror movie means this isn't a quick party game you can play anytime - you need to dedicate 90-120 minutes to both the game and a film. However, for groups who were already planning to watch horror movies, it adds significant value to the experience.
