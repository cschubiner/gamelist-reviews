## Overview
**Platform:** PC (Steam)
**Players:** Up to 12 players (local or remote, keyboards/gamepads/smartphones)
**Price:** Available on Steam (often 40% discount)
**Release Date:** Early Access
**Developer/Publisher:** reaktron team

## Gameplay & Mechanics

reaktron is a multiplayer reimagining of the classic snake game, supporting up to 12 players across flexible control options including keyboards, gamepads, and even smartphones. The game builds upon the minimalistic C64 snake game concept but adds modern complexity through power-ups and competitive multiplayer dynamics.

**Core Gameplay:**
Like traditional snake games, players control a growing line that must avoid colliding with boundaries, obstacles, and other players while consuming items to grow longer. The fundamental challenge of navigating increasingly constrained space with an ever-growing tail remains central to the experience.

**Power-Ups:**
The game introduces various power-ups to add strategic depth and chaos, with the most notable being the REVERSER. According to developers, this and other additions make reaktron "probably the most complex snake game ever," though this also moves it away from the elegant simplicity that made the original snake concept so accessible.

**Multiplayer Flexibility:**
Supports both online and couch (local) multiplayer, with control options spanning traditional gaming peripherals and smartphones, maximizing accessibility for diverse group configurations.

**Early Access Status:**
As an Early Access title, the game continues active development with ongoing improvements and feature additions.

## Fun Factor

reaktron attempts to capture the simple appeal of snake games while adding competitive multiplayer chaos. The basic concept remains fundamentally entertaining - the tension of navigating tight spaces with an unwieldy growing tail translates well to competitive play where you must also dodge other players' snakes.

However, user feedback reveals significant usability concerns. Retro Freak Reviews noted the game was "really difficult to play online or/and offline," suggesting fundamental issues with both connectivity and local multiplayer implementation. For a game built entirely around multiplayer snake gameplay, difficulty in actually playing undermines the core appeal.

## Player Count Experience

**Optimal:** 4-8 players
**Supported:** 1-12 players (local or online)
**Control Options:** Keyboards, gamepads, smartphones

The support for 12 simultaneous players with flexible control schemes (keyboards, gamepads, smartphones) theoretically offers excellent accessibility and scalability. However, the reported difficulties with online and offline play suggest the theoretical player count may not translate to smooth practical experiences.

The variety of control options is commendable - supporting smartphones alongside traditional controllers lowers barriers to entry for casual groups. However, these benefits are negated if the fundamental multiplayer functionality is problematic.

## Technical Considerations

**Early Access Status:** Ongoing development means bugs and issues should be expected
**Multiplayer Issues:** User reports indicate difficulties with both online and offline play
**Control Flexibility:** Support for keyboards, gamepads, and smartphones requires robust input handling

The most significant technical concern is the reported difficulty playing online or offline. For a game whose entire premise is multiplayer snake gameplay, connectivity and local multiplayer problems represent critical failures that prevent the game from delivering its core promise.

## Overall Reception

**Steam User Score:** Limited review data available
**Critical Reception:** Minimal professional coverage
**Community Feedback:** Mixed, with usability concerns highlighted
**Development Status:** Early Access with active updates

### Strengths:
- Classic snake game concept with multiplayer twist
- Supports up to 12 players
- Flexible control options (keyboards, gamepads, smartphones)
- Both online and local multiplayer supported
- Power-ups add strategic complexity
- Early Access shows ongoing development
- Builds on nostalgic C64 game roots

### Weaknesses:
- Reported as "really difficult to play online or/and offline"
- Fundamental multiplayer functionality issues
- Added complexity may dilute simple snake game appeal
- Limited review coverage makes assessment difficult
- Early Access uncertainty about completion
- Technical issues undermine core gameplay promise

## Verdict

reaktron represents an interesting attempt to evolve the classic snake game formula into a competitive multiplayer experience with modern features. The concept has merit - snake games have proven their staying power, and competitive multiplayer adds natural tension and excitement.

However, critical execution problems prevent recommendation in its current state. When a reviewer specifically notes that the game is "really difficult to play online or/and offline," that indicates fundamental issues with the core multiplayer implementation. For a game built entirely around multiplayer snake gameplay, this is a disqualifying flaw.

The Early Access status offers hope that these issues might be resolved with continued development, but potential buyers should be aware they're purchasing a problematic product with uncertain improvement timeline.

**Recommendation Status:** Cannot recommend in current state

**Potentially Recommended for (Future):** If multiplayer functionality issues are resolved, could appeal to snake game nostalgists, casual multiplayer groups, fans of simple competitive games, retro gaming enthusiasts

**Currently Not Recommended for:** Anyone seeking reliable multiplayer experiences, groups planning gaming sessions, players intolerant of technical issues, those requiring functional online/offline play

**Suggested Approach:** Monitor Early Access development updates. If future patches address the reported online/offline functionality problems, reassess. In its current state, the game cannot deliver on its core promise of accessible multiplayer snake gameplay.
