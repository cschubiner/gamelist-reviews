# Couch Cup

## Overview
Couch Cup is an Early Access party game billed as "the ultimate party game" where 3-12 players compete in a variety of hilarious mini-games. Players connect their phones to a TV, customize avatars, and dive into unpredictable competitive and cooperative challenges, all hosted by a witty AI personality. Currently in development, the game offers both local and online multiplayer experiences.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Couch Cup delivers a mini-game collection experience in the vein of games like Jackbox Party Pack, with players using their phones as controllers while the main action displays on a TV or computer screen.

**Core Features:**
- **Phone-Based Controls:** Players connect smartphones to participate, eliminating need for multiple controllers
- **Avatar Customization:** Personalize your character before competing
- **AI Host:** A quirky AI personality provides commentary, reacts to performances, and keeps energy high
- **Mini-Game Variety:** Over a dozen different mini-games spanning multiple genres

**Game Types:**
- **Trivia Games:** Test general knowledge
- **Strategic Challenges:** Outwit opponents through tactical thinking
- **Creative Games:** Drawing, debating, and storytelling activities
- **Physical Challenges:** Reaction-based and timing games
- **Team Games:** Select mini-games support cooperative play and team competitions (soccer matches, team debates, etc.)

**Competitive Modes:**
Players can compete individually, cooperatively, or in team-based configurations depending on the mini-game selected, providing flexibility for different group dynamics and preferences.

## Fun Factor
Couch Cup aims to deliver the accessibility and variety that makes party game collections engaging. The AI host adds personality and dynamic commentary that responds to player actions, potentially creating memorable moments beyond the mini-games themselves.

The variety of game types - from trivia to drawing to physical challenges - means different players can shine in different areas, keeping all participants engaged across the session. The phone-based control scheme removes technical barriers, allowing anyone with a smartphone to join easily.

As an Early Access title, the game is actively developing, meaning the current experience may evolve substantially based on community feedback and developer additions.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** 3-12 players (local and online multiplayer)

**Multiplayer Modes:**
- **Local Multiplayer:** Players in same location connect phones to shared display
- **Online Multiplayer:** Remote players join via their devices
- **Team-Based:** Select mini-games divide players into teams for cooperative play

The 3-12 player range provides good flexibility:
- **3-5 Players:** Intimate competition with personal dynamics
- **6-9 Players:** Sweet spot for balanced chaos and variety
- **10-12 Players:** Maximum party atmosphere with diverse competition

The phone-based control system is a significant advantage for large groups - no need to collect 12 controllers. Anyone with a smartphone can participate, making it highly accessible for parties and gatherings.
