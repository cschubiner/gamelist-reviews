## Overview
The Jackbox Party Pack 8 includes five games: Drawful Animate, The Wheel of Enormous Proportions, Job Job, The Poll Mine, and Weapons Drawn. This installment is considered by many to be the best the series has seen in a while, with no major duds among the five games included.

## Games Included

### Drawful Animate (3-10 players)
Players draw two pictures instead of one, which act as a flipbook to help describe things. The rest plays out like classic Drawful, with players guessing drawings while making up fake answers to fool others.

### Job Job (3-10 players)
As a job applicant, players answer personal icebreaker questions in the first round. In the interview round, they can only use words other players used in their icebreakers to answer new questions. Widely praised as "one of the best games in the history of Jackbox Party Pack."

### The Wheel of Enormous Proportions (2-8 players)
This game combines trivia with chance-based wheel spinning. Players do well in trivia to gain wedges to place anywhere on the wheel. After trivia, players take turns spinning, sending points to whoever the wheel lands on.

### The Poll Mine (2-10 players)
The first ever head-to-head team game in a Jackbox pack. Teams are given a prompt with eight possible answers, and each person selects the top three most popular options based on survey data.

### Weapons Drawn (4-8 players)
Like Cluedo if everyone was the murderer. Players draw two murder weapons with a unique letter hidden in the drawing. They create a guest name and select a different guest to murder - but only if other players guess they brought that guest.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Following the Jackbox formula, players use their phones, tablets, or computers as controllers by visiting Jackbox.tv and entering a room code. This allows for easy accessibility without needing multiple controllers. The games support both local and streaming play, making them ideal for content creators.

## Fun Factor
Pack 8 delivers consistent entertainment across all five games. The variety ensures that groups with different preferences will find something they enjoy. Job Job's word-scrambling chaos and Weapons Drawn's social deduction provide standout moments. The absence of weak games makes this pack a reliable choice for parties.

## Player Count Experience
The games accommodate 2-10 players depending on the specific game, with most supporting larger groups. The Poll Mine's team-based gameplay offers a new dynamic for the series. All games support audience participation, allowing additional people to join in voting and influencing outcomes even when player slots are full.
