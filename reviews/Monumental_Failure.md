# Monumental Failure - Review Summary

## Game Overview
**Monumental Failure** is a physics-based monument construction simulator developed by Scary Wizard Games (a two-person Toronto-based indie studio). Players use unconventional methods like trampolines, jetpacks, helicopters, and Segways to construct historical monuments across 70 levels spanning 7 worlds.

## GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS

### Core Mechanics
- **Simple two-button control scheme**: Players use only left/right analog sticks to move characters and a confirm button to lock pieces
- **Split-team control**: Players simultaneously control dual teams of builders (WASD for one team, arrow keys for the other in single-player)
- **Physics-based puzzles**: Position monument sections accurately while navigating obstacles like revolving platforms
- **Star/point system**: Performance unlocks new monuments and locations

### Strengths
- Quick to pick up and play with minimal learning curve
- Creative challenge design across 60-70 levels
- Quirky, absurd scenarios that embrace failure as entertainment
- Accessible to both experienced gamers and novices

### Weaknesses
- **Flying controls are problematic**: Helicopters, jetpacks, and aerial gadgets have poor, unreliable controls
- **Unclear objectives**: Some challenges fail to explain what players should do, making certain tasks "damn near impossible"
- **Fairness issues**: Things outside player control can easily ruin scores
- **Limited content**: Only 6-7 monuments requires repeated playthroughs

## FUN FACTOR

### What Works
- **"Fun in failure" philosophy**: Spectacular failures generate humor and entertainment
- **Short burst appeal**: Enjoyable in 30-minute to 1-hour sessions
- **Lighthearted chaos**: Colorful, quirky aesthetic prioritizes fun over realism
- **Worker customization**: Humorous outfit options add personality

### Limitations
- **Becomes stale**: Repetitive gameplay leads to diminishing returns in extended play
- **Frustration over enjoyment**: Control issues and unclear objectives often overshadow the fun
- **Limited long-term appeal**: Not designed for marathon sessions

## PLAYER COUNT EXPERIENCE

### Multiplayer Modes
- **2-4 player split-screen competitive**
- **2-4 player local cooperative**
- **4-10 player team competitive** (2-4 players per team, up to 4 teams)

### Critical Consensus on Player Count
**Cooperative play is essential** - All three reviewers emphasized:
- Single-player is "serviceable but a little dull"
- Co-op transforms it into "a totally different game"
- "Much more fun than doing it on your own"
- Coordination and communication challenges enhance the experience
- Works great as a party game with friends or non-gamers

### Cooperative Dynamics
- Each player controls some characters, requiring teamwork
- Split-control system creates intentional coordination challenges
- Communication failures amplify both frustration and humor

### Final Verdict
Invision Community summarized it well: **"Monumental Failure is en route to becoming a truly classic couch co-op game, but it isn't there just yet."** At its £10/$10 price point, it's best viewed as a lighthearted cooperative party game rather than a serious gaming investment. The game delivers on its humorous premise when played with friends but needs additional polish, clearer objectives, and improved controls to reach its full potential.
