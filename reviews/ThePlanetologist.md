# The Planetologist

## Overview
The Planetologist is a pixel art, local multiplayer co-op, top-down shooter where players take on the role of scientists exploring the galaxy aboard their ship. The game focuses on battling a mysterious and deadly infection threatening to wipe out all life in the universe while exploring diverse planetary ecosystems.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The Planetologist combines exploration, scientific discovery, and combat in a pixel art package. As a planetologist (planetary ecologist), players travel to various planets to study ecosystems, document discoveries, and combat the deadly infection spreading through the universe.

**Game Modes:**
- **Story Mode:** Narrative-driven campaign following the fight against the infection
- **Survival Mode:** Endless survival against increasingly difficult threats
- **Extraction Mode:** Mission-based gameplay with extraction objectives

The top-down shooter mechanics focus on cooperative play, requiring teamwork to manage threats while conducting planetary research. The pixel art style creates a retro aesthetic while delivering modern gameplay systems.

The game emphasizes both combat and exploration, balancing action sequences with discovery and documentation of alien ecosystems. This dual focus creates variety in gameplay beyond pure shooting.

## Fun Factor
Community feedback from itch.io suggests The Planetologist offers addictive gameplay despite its indie origins. Players praise the pixel art style and engaging mechanics. The cooperative nature creates opportunities for teamwork and coordination, essential for managing both combat threats and scientific objectives.

The three game modes provide different experiences - Story for narrative progression, Survival for endless challenge, and Extraction for focused mission-based play. This variety helps maintain interest across multiple sessions.

The infection threat creates urgency and stakes for the exploration gameplay, while the scientific mission framework gives context and purpose beyond simple shooting.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** Local multiplayer co-op (specific player count not detailed in available information)

The game is designed specifically for local co-op play, emphasizing teamwork between players exploring together. The cooperative structure suggests the game works best with at least 2 players working together to manage combat, exploration, and research objectives.

The local multiplayer focus means players need to be in the same physical space, making it a couch co-op experience rather than an online multiplayer game.
