# Click on lanterns together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on lanterns together is a multiplayer hidden object game featuring an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic environment filled with 100+ lanterns to discover. Players compete to locate and click lanterns, marking them in their selected color before other players can claim them.

Players navigate through the panoramic scene by clicking and dragging with the mouse or using alternative controls including keyboard (WASD, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) or gamepads. This flexibility allows multiple players to use different input methods simultaneously based on their preferences.

Each player selects a color at the start, and when they find and click a lantern, it glows in their chosen color. The game displays a scoreboard once all objects are found, showing each player's contributions. Color themes can be customized in-game to reduce eye strain during extended sessions.

The game supports multiple connectivity options: local play with various input devices, Steam Remote Play for streaming gameplay, LAN connections over WiFi, and experimental online play using a P2P system where both host and player enter each other's IP addresses (no port forwarding required).

There's no time limit, creating a relaxed competitive atmosphere that prioritizes enjoyment and social interaction over speed and pressure.

## Fun Factor

Click on lanterns together offers a calming yet engaging competitive experience. The lantern theme creates an atmospheric, visually appealing scene that's pleasant to explore. The hand-drawn artwork provides artistic value beyond simple object hunting, making the search itself aesthetically enjoyable.

The absence of time pressure allows players to chat and socialize while searching, making it ideal for casual gaming sessions with friends or family. The competitive element adds engagement without creating stress - players race to find objects but in a friendly, low-stakes manner.

The 100+ hidden lanterns provide substantial content for extended play sessions without feeling overwhelming. The detailed artwork rewards careful observation and creates satisfying moments when particularly well-hidden lanterns are discovered.

## Player Count Experience

Click on lanterns together supports unlimited players, limited only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) provides exceptional flexibility for different group configurations.

The shared-screen format where all players view the same scene creates a communal experience. Players can react to each other's discoveries, groan when someone finds a lantern they were searching for, or celebrate particularly clever finds. This social dynamic enhances the experience beyond simple competition.

The game scales effectively across player counts. Solo players enjoy a meditative search experience, pairs engage in focused head-to-head competition, and larger groups create more dynamic, fast-paced searches. The unlimited player support makes it suitable for gatherings and parties of any size.
