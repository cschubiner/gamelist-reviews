# Casual Pro Wrestling

## Overview
Casual Pro Wrestling is a professional wrestling game inspired by the first 3D pro wrestling games from the classic era, enhanced with ragdoll physics for increased whiplash and chaotic fun. The game is currently in Early Access and offers a sandbox-style wrestling experience with character creation and customization.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Casual Pro Wrestling emphasizes fun and accessibility while delivering a physics-based wrestling experience. The game features ragdoll physics that create unpredictable and entertaining moments during matches. Players can create and customize their own wrestlers and participate in various match types. Currently, the game is more of a sandbox experience without championship, career, or booking modes, but these features are planned for future development.

The controls are designed to be straightforward while allowing for creative and dynamic wrestling moves. The physics engine creates opportunities for both intentional strategy and hilarious accidents, making each match unique.

## Fun Factor

The sandbox nature allows players to experiment and create their own fun, though the lack of structured modes may limit long-term engagement for some players.
