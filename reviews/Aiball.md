## Overview
Aiball is a physics-based local multiplayer game that has undergone significant changes throughout its troubled development. Originally designed as a physics-based soccer game for up to 10 local players, it later transformed into an online game about penguins navigating obstacle courses. The game's identity crisis and abandoned development make it a cautionary tale in Steam's Early Access catalog.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game enables local play on the same computer with controllers, but notably lacks online multiplayer functionality. Players can compete in various modes including football, obstacle courses, wrestling, and mortal battles with weapons. The physics-based gameplay was intended to create unpredictable and humorous moments.

However, significant issues plague the experience. The AI players are reportedly inanimate, with reviewers comparing it to "doing FIFA with static players." The game never achieved a stable, polished state before development ceased.

## Fun Factor
Aiball's fun factor is severely hampered by its development issues and technical problems. While the concept of physics-based party games has merit, the execution falls short. The abandoned development status means bugs and balance issues were never addressed, and the lack of variety in content limits replayability.

## Player Count Experience
Originally designed for up to 10 local players, the game theoretically supports large group play. However, the static AI and technical issues make it difficult to recommend for parties or gatherings. The lack of online play further limits its appeal in an era where remote gaming has become increasingly important.

## Overall Reception

### Critic Scores

- Limited coverage due to indie/Early Access status

### User Scores
- **Steam:** 51% Positive (141 user reviews) - "Mixed"
- Negative reviews cite abandoned development and game-breaking issues

### Key Takeaways
Aiball represents a cautionary example of Early Access gone wrong. The developer's last update was over 9 years ago, leaving the game in an incomplete and broken state. The game underwent a significant identity change during development, shifting from a physics soccer game to something entirely different, confusing and disappointing early supporters.

At $0.99, the price is low, but reviewers warn that even at this cost, the game struggles to provide value. The static AI, lack of updates, and abandoned status make it impossible to recommend despite the low barrier to entry. Players seeking physics-based party games would be better served by numerous other completed and supported alternatives on Steam.

The mixed 51% rating on Steam reflects player disappointment more than gameplay quality - many reviews focus on broken promises and abandoned development rather than the actual game experience.
