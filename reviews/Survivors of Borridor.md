# Survivors of Borridor

## Game Overview
Survivors of Borridor is a fast-paced top-down couch co-op survival game for PC. It uniquely allows players to join using their smartphone browser, turning their phones into controllers. Players work together to survive waves of challenges on a single screen.

## Platforms
- PC (Steam)
- Linux

## Player Count
- 1-8 players
- Local co-op only
- Single screen gameplay
- Smartphones can be used as controllers (connected via WiFi)

## Pricing
Available on Steam (pricing varies, check current Steam listing)

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Fast-paced survival gameplay where players:
- Cooperate on a single screen
- Fight through waves of enemies/challenges
- Use smartphones as wireless controllers when connected to the same WiFi network
- Work as a team to survive progressively difficult scenarios

The game is strictly single-screen local multiplayer with no online play option. Players must be in the same physical location to play together.

## Fun Factor
The phone-as-controller mechanic removes the barrier of needing multiple gamepads, making it more accessible for impromptu gaming sessions. The fast-paced survival gameplay creates intense cooperative moments where teamwork is essential for success.

## Player Count Experience
- **Optimal Range**: 4-6 players
- **Minimum**: 1 player
- **Maximum**: 8 players (local co-op only)
More players increase the chaos and coordination challenge, though the single-screen nature means too many players could create visual clutter.

## Overall Reception
Limited critical reception with modest player base. The game hasn't achieved significant visibility in the crowded indie game market.

### Review Scores
- Metacritic: Has critic and user review sections but limited coverage
- Steam ownership: 0-20,000 owners (per SteamSpy data)

### Notable Comments
- Released: December 2018
- Developer hasn't achieved widespread attention
- Phone controller mechanic is innovative for accessibility
- Local-only limitation restricts potential player base
- Last update information not readily available

The game serves a niche for local co-op survival fans who want smartphone controller support, but hasn't broken through to mainstream success.
