# Sid Meier's Civilization V

## Overview
Sid Meier's Civilization V is the fifth main installment in the legendary Civilization series. Released in 2010, it revolutionized the series by removing unit stacking and introducing hexagonal tiles, creating a more tactical and streamlined 4X strategy experience. While it had a rocky launch, the game became one of the best entries in the series after its expansions.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

It's perfect for players who enjoy long-form strategic thinking and empire building.
