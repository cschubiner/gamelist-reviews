# Made to Order: The Party Game Review

## Overview
Made to Order: The Party Game is a memory-based party game developed and published by Mega Dwarf Inc. Released in June 2018, it bills itself as "the world's #1 food-stacking themed memory-based party game," combining memorization challenges with the chaos of managing difficult restaurant customers.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Players must strain their brains to remember peculiar orders from patrons while dealing with demanding customers. The core gameplay revolves around:
- **Memory Challenges:** Remembering specific food orders
- **Order Stacking:** Recalling the sequence of ingredients
- **Customer Management:** Handling difficult patron requests
- **Party Mode:** Up to 8 friends can compete together
- **Solo Mode:** Single-player option available
- **Mobile App:** Players download a mobile application to join and compete

The game tests memory and quick recall in a food service setting, creating pressure as orders become more complex and customers more demanding.

## Fun Factor
The concept of combining memory games with the stress of food service has potential for humor and frantic fun. The peculiar orders and difficult customers likely create comedic moments as players struggle to remember increasingly complex requests.

However, the mixed reception (40% positive reviews) suggests the execution may not fully deliver on the concept's promise, with gameplay potentially becoming repetitive or frustrating rather than consistently entertaining.

## Player Count Experience
- **Party Mode:** Up to 8 players
- **Solo Mode:** 1 player
- **Best For:** Groups of 4-8 players
- **Requirements:** Players download mobile app to participate

The 8-player capacity is solid for party games, though requiring a mobile app download may create entry friction compared to browser-based competitors.

## Platforms
- **Steam (PC)**
- **Mobile App:** Required download for players to join party mode

## Overall Reception

### Critical Scores
- **Steam User Reviews:** 40% positive (10 reviews) - Mixed reception

### Limited Data
Only 10 reviews suggests a very small player base, making it difficult to assess broader reception. The 40% positive rating indicates more players were dissatisfied than satisfied.

### Strengths
- Unique food-stacking memory theme
- Supports up to 8 players
- Party and solo modes available

- Very limited player base (10 reviews total)

- Requires mobile app download for party play
- Niche appeal of food-stacking theme
- May lack depth or variety
- Limited content and replay value suggested by reviews

## Verdict
Made to Order: The Party Game presents an interesting concept - a memory-based party game themed around restaurant order chaos. However, the 40% positive rating from a tiny sample size of 10 reviews suggests significant execution issues. The game hasn't gained traction since its 2018 release, indicating it failed to capture an audience despite the novelty of its theme.

For those specifically interested in memory-based party games or restaurant simulation themes, the 8-player support and unique concept might warrant investigation during a deep sale. However, the mixed reception and minimal player base suggest most groups would be better served by more established party games with proven track records.

The requirement for a mobile app download adds friction compared to browser-based alternatives, and the limited reviews provide little confidence in the game's ability to maintain interest beyond initial novelty. Unless you're specifically drawn to the food-stacking memory challenge theme and can find it heavily discounted, there are more reliable party game options available that offer better value and more consistent entertainment.
