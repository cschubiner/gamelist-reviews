# Use Your Words Review

## Overview
Use Your Words is a party game from Smiling Buddha Games that challenges players' creativity and wit across four distinct mini-games. Released across multiple platforms, it follows the phone-as-controller party game formula popularized by Jackbox Games, supporting 3-6 active players plus up to 1,000 spectators.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game includes four creative mini-games:

1. **Sub the Title:** Players write subtitles for foreign film clips, creating humorous alternative dialogue
2. **Extra! Extra!:** Create funny newspaper headlines for unusual images
3. **Blank-O-Matic:** Fill in blanks in unfinished sentences, Mad Libs style
4. **Survey Says:** Write responses to prompts in the style of Family Feud, trying to match what others will say

Players use web-enabled devices (smartphones, tablets, or computers) as controllers, with no app download required. The games reward creativity, humor, and sometimes the ability to think like your fellow players.

## Fun Factor
The variety in mini-games ensures different types of creativity are exercised - from comedic writing to strategic thinking. The foreign film subtitle game is particularly unique and often generates the most laughs. The voting system where players choose the funniest submissions creates competitive tension while celebrating creativity.

Success depends heavily on your group's wit and willingness to be creative. With the right crowd, Use Your Words delivers consistent laughs. With less engaged players, the experience can fall flat.

## Player Count Experience
- **Active Players:** 3-6 players
- **Spectators:** Up to 1,000 can watch and participate in voting
- **Best For:** Groups of 4-6 creative players

The game works best with players who enjoy writing and creative challenges. Smaller player counts (3-4) may limit answer variety, while the full 6-player experience provides more diverse and hilarious responses.

## Platforms
- **Steam (PC)**
- **Nintendo Switch**
- **PlayStation**
- **Xbox**
- **Mobile (iOS/Android) - via browser**

## Pricing
- **Standard Price:** $14.99
- A sequel, **Use Your Words 2**, is also available for $14.99

## Overall Reception

### Critical Scores
- **Steam User Reviews:** 90% positive (741 reviews) - "Very Positive"
- **Nintendo Switch (Metacritic):** Mixed or average reviews

### Platform Differences
The PC version receives much stronger reviews than the Switch version, suggesting potential technical or implementation differences across platforms.

### Strengths
- Four distinct mini-game types provide variety
- Foreign film subtitle game is uniquely entertaining
- No app download required - browser-based controllers
- Large spectator capacity (1,000 viewers)
- Rewards creativity and humor
- Strong Steam reception (90% positive)
- Multiple platform availability
- Good value at $14.99

### Weaknesses
- Requires creative, engaged players to shine
- Switch version received mixed reviews
- Smaller player count range (3-6) than some competitors
- Content can become familiar after many sessions
- Success heavily dependent on group dynamics
- Writing-heavy gameplay may not appeal to all
- Less polished than Jackbox equivalents

## Verdict
Use Your Words successfully delivers creative party game entertainment at an affordable price point. The four mini-games offer good variety, with the foreign film subtitle game standing out as particularly innovative. The 90% positive Steam rating demonstrates strong player satisfaction on PC, though the mixed Switch reviews suggest platform matters when purchasing.

The game works best with creative, witty groups who enjoy writing challenges and improvised humor. If your friends appreciate games like Quiplash or Fibbage but want something different, Use Your Words provides similar energy with unique twists. However, it may not reach the same polish level as premium Jackbox titles. For $14.99, it's a solid value for groups seeking phone-controlled party gaming with a creative bent, especially on PC where it's most highly rated.
