# Goalie VR

## Game Overview
Goalie VR is a virtual reality hockey goaltending game developed by Hailstone Games. Players experience the intensity of defending their goal against opposing players in an immersive VR environment. The game allows players to face off against AI opponents or compete against friends using compatible mobile devices.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
