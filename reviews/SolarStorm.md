# Solar Storm

## Overview
Solar Storm exists in two distinct versions: a turn-based sci-fi artillery video game on Steam supporting massive multiplayer battles, and a cooperative survival board game for 1-4 players published by Dranda Games. This review focuses on both versions as they share the same name but offer different experiences.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

### Video Game Version (Steam)
Solar Storm is a turn-based sci-fi artillery game featuring lots of explosions and unique weapons. Players engage in tactical combat across procedurally generated and fully destructible arenas. The game supports casual play with friends in environments that change dynamically as players unleash devastating weapons. The turn-based nature allows for strategic thinking while the destructible terrain adds an extra layer of tactical consideration.

### Board Game Version
The board game is a cooperative survival experience where 1-4 players work together as a crew managing a spaceship during a catastrophic solar storm. Hand management and teamwork are crucial as players must make critical decisions to keep their ship operational and survive the journey. The game is known for its punishing difficulty, requiring coordination and careful resource management.

## Fun Factor

### Video Game
The video game offers explosive, casual fun perfect for group sessions. The massive player count (up to 32 players) and destructible arenas create chaotic and entertaining battles. The variety of unique weapons keeps gameplay fresh and unpredictable.

### Board Game
The board game delivers intense cooperative gameplay with high replayability. While described as "punishingly hard," fans of challenging co-op games find it rewarding. The game offers multiple difficulty settings and ways to customize the experience, making it accessible for different skill levels while maintaining its core challenge. Despite its difficulty, reviewers praise it as a fantastic small box game with excellent value.

## Player Count Experience
