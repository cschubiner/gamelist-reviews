# Unfriend

## Game Overview
Unfriend is an indie couch party game for 6 players where players use their own personal media (photos, videos, drawings, or text) to create unique experiences filled with inside jokes and special memories. Using phones and browsers as controllers, players send their own files directly from their devices to build unexpected and personalized scripts that make the whole group laugh.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Prompting and voting-based party game
- 6 players use phones/tablets as controllers via web browsers
- Players submit their own personal media (photos, videos, drawings, text)
- Media is incorporated into game prompts and scenarios
- Voting mechanics determine winners
- Personalized content creates unique experiences every time
- Browser-based controller system (no app download needed)
- Shared screen displays the results

## Fun Factor
Unfriend's unique selling point is the personal media integration, which transforms generic party game prompts into deeply personal, hilarious moments. Using your own photos and inside jokes makes every playthrough completely unique to your group. This creates potential for both heartwarming nostalgia and ruthless comedy depending on what content players choose to share. The personalization means the game gets better the more history your group shares. However, this also means it may not work well with strangers or new acquaintances. Best for close friend groups with shared memories and mutual trust.
