- Steam (planned for summer 2024)

## Gameplay & Mechanics
A digital evolution of the telephone game where:
1. Players start with an initial prompt or image
2. AI generates pictures based on player descriptions
3. Next player describes what they see
4. AI generates a new image from that description
5. Process repeats, creating increasingly hilarious deviations from the original

The game leverages AI image generation to create unpredictable and often absurd visual interpretations, combining the social fun of traditional telephone with modern AI capabilities.

## Fun Factor
The AI-generated images add unpredictability and visual humor that traditional telephone games can't match. Watching how images transform through AI interpretation and player descriptions creates unique comedic moments. The accessibility via web browser makes it easy to start playing without downloads or installations.

## Player Count Experience
- **Optimal Range**: Not specified (likely 4-8 players based on genre)
- **Minimum**: Not specified (likely 3-4 players)
- **Maximum**: Not specified
As a telephone-style game, it needs enough players to create a chain of interpretations but not so many that games become too long.

## Overall Reception
Very limited reception data available. The game appears to be relatively new or indie with minimal critical coverage.
