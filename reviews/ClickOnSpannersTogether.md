# Click on spanners together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on spanners together is a hidden object search game featuring an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic environment containing 100+ spanners scattered throughout the scene. Players compete to find and click spanners before their opponents, with each discovered spanner marked in the player's chosen color.

The game is played by clicking and dragging to pan across the detailed artwork, then clicking on spanners when found to claim them. Alternative control methods include arrow keys (WASD, TFGH, IJKL) or gamepads, providing accessibility for different play preferences and allowing multiple players to use different input methods simultaneously.

A key feature is the customizable color themes that can be adjusted in-game to be less harsh on the eyes during extended play sessions. Each player selects a color at the start, and their discoveries glow in that color, making it easy to track who found what.

The game supports multiple connection methods: local play with mouse/keyboard/gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN over the same WiFi, and experimental P2P online connectivity that doesn't require port forwarding. This experimental online system requires both host and player to enter each other's IP addresses.

There's no time limit, creating a relaxed, casual atmosphere where players can take their time searching without pressure.

## Fun Factor

The appeal lies in the meditative quality of searching detailed artwork combined with friendly competition. The hand-drawn art style provides visual interest beyond simple object hunting, making the search itself enjoyable. The absence of time pressure allows for a more social, conversational experience where players can chat while searching.

The competitive element is gentle - players race to find objects, but the relaxed pacing prevents frustration. The ability to customize colors helps reduce eye strain, showing consideration for player comfort during longer sessions. The game works equally well as a casual solo experience or a competitive group activity.

The 100+ hidden objects provide substantial content, ensuring games last long enough to be satisfying without becoming tedious. The detailed artwork rewards close inspection and creates "aha!" moments when spotting well-hidden spanners.

## Player Count Experience

Click on spanners together supports unlimited players locally, limited only by available input devices. The support for mouse, keyboard, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online play provides exceptional flexibility in how groups can play together.

The game works well across different player counts. Solo play offers a relaxing search experience, while multiplayer adds competitive excitement. The shared-screen format (all players viewing the same panoramic scene) creates a social atmosphere where players can react to each other's discoveries.

The experimental online mode extends multiplayer beyond local gatherings, though the IP address exchange requirement may present technical barriers for some users. The variety of connection options means technical-savvy groups can play remotely while less technical groups can easily set up local multiplayer.
