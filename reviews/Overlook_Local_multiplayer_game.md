# Overlook: Local Multiplayer Game - Review Summary

Based on my research, I found limited formal reviews for "Overlook: Local multiplayer game - up to 16 players" by Gametroleum. The game has very minimal critical coverage, with only 3 user reviews on Steam (insufficient to generate a rating). Here's what I was able to compile from available sources:

## OVERLOOK: LOCAL MULTIPLAYER GAME - REVIEW SUMMARY

### Game Overview

- **Release Date:** June 27, 2018
- **Price:** $14.99
- **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, Linux (Steam)
- **Player Count:** 2-16 players (requires up to 8 gamepads)

---

### GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS

**Core Concept:**
- Team-based asymmetric multiplayer inspired by "Hidden in Plain Sight"
- Players split into two distinct roles:
  - **Infected/Defective Robots:** Goal is to infect/destroy as many robots as possible while remaining hidden
  - **Overseers:** Must identify and eliminate infected robots by placing markers on suspected players

**Key Mechanics:**
- The game hides infected robot positions until overseers place markers directly on them
- Infected players can move freely and spread infection if they stay away from opponent markers
- Described as "a game of moves, plays and observation skills"
- Local multiplayer only (shared/split screen)
- Supports Steam Remote Play Together

### CRITICAL RECEPTION

**Major Concerns Identified:**

**Controls & Usability (Negative):**
- Multiple users reported "dreadful" controls
- One reviewer stated: "It took me 10 minutes to work out how to change between the robot and the grabber pre-game"
- Control responsiveness issues during gameplay with some players unable to locate their robots

**Polish & Functionality (Negative):**
- Described as "lacking polish and functionality from start to finish"
- Criticisms included: "Everything from controls, graphics, to basic functionality is missing"
- One reviewer noted: "It would be a stretch to even call this ready for Early Access, let alone a full release"

**Visual Presentation (Mixed):**
- At least one user commented positively: "Game looks fantastic"
- However, this was offset by control and functionality issues

---

### FUN FACTOR

**Limited Data Available:**
- No detailed positive reviews found discussing actual enjoyment or party game success
- The concept (inspired by Hidden in Plain Sight) suggests potential for strategic deception gameplay
- Designed for "small or big groups of friends"
- However, technical issues appear to severely hamper the fun factor based on user complaints

---

### PLAYER COUNT EXPERIENCE

**Ambitious Scope:**
- Advertises support for up to 16 players (a significant increase over its 2-4 player inspiration, Hidden in Plain Sight)
- Requires up to 8 gamepads for maximum player count
- No specific reviews found discussing the actual experience at different player counts
- Unknown whether the game works better/worse at lower vs. higher player counts

---

### OVERALL RECEPTION

**Review Volume:**
- **Steam:** Only 3 user reviews (all negative) - insufficient for a rating score
- **Steam Curators:** 5 curators reviewed the product
- **Professional Reviews:** No major gaming outlets appear to have reviewed the game
- **IndieDB/ModDB:** Game is listed but no substantial reviews found

**Conclusion:**
The game suffers from extremely limited exposure and overwhelmingly negative reception from the small number of users who have reviewed it. Primary complaints center around poor controls, lack of polish, and incomplete functionality. The ambitious 16-player concept appears undermined by execution issues. The game has failed to gain traction in the local multiplayer party game market despite being inspired by the well-regarded Hidden in Plain Sight.
