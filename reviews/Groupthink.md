## Overview
Groupthink is a party game about working together with teammates to come up with silly answers - one letter at a time! Players join through their browsers on either computers or mobile devices, making it highly accessible for remote or in-person play.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
One player is selected as the judge who either chooses a question or submits their own. All remaining players are split into two teams and must take turns submitting one letter at a time to come up with the best answer they can. The judge then chooses the answer they like better, and that team is rewarded points.

The game also features Comedy Mode, where all players are put on one team and work together to make the best answers they can. No points are awarded in this mode, and the focus is entirely on wacky, goofy, nonsensical fun.

The letter-by-letter answering system creates hilarious situations as teams try to coordinate their responses without direct communication about their full answer.

## Fun Factor
Groupthink excels at creating spontaneous comedy through its collaborative letter-writing mechanic. The tension of not knowing where your teammates are going with an answer, combined with the judge's subjective choices, leads to memorable moments and plenty of laughter. Comedy Mode offers a more relaxed experience for groups that prefer cooperative play over competition.

## Player Count Experience
The game requires a minimum of 3 players (including the judge) but shines with larger groups, supporting up to 16 players. With smaller groups, rounds move quickly but may lack variety. Larger groups create more chaotic and entertaining results as teams struggle to coordinate their letter-by-letter responses. The browser-based format makes it easy to accommodate varying group sizes.

### Key Takeaways

Best suited for groups that enjoy word games and improvisational comedy.
