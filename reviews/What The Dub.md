## Overview
What The Dub?! is a multiplayer party game where players overdub missing dialogue from hilariously awful B-movies, woefully outdated PSAs, and bizarre industrial films with their own witty (or just plain stupid) dubs. One player starts a game with a four-digit room code, and up to 12 players visit the official website on phones or PCs to join.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The gameplay loop is elegantly simple: players watch a clip from an old movie with part of the dialogue clipped out and left blank. Once the clip ends, every player types what they think the missing dialogue should be into their browser. Players can also add sound effects from a separate menu to enhance their dubs.

The game then replays the clips using text-to-speech to speak out the lines that everyone typed. Players watch all the dubs and vote on the best one. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. The text-to-speech adds an extra layer of comedy to the proceedings.

## Fun Factor
What The Dub?! is an enjoyable party game that gives everyone a chance to show off their comedic chops. The vintage footage provides endless entertainment, and seeing your carefully crafted jokes delivered in robotic text-to-speech often makes them even funnier. The voting system keeps everyone engaged even when not writing, as players anticipate which dubs will win.

## Player Count Experience
With support for up to 12 players accessing via browsers, What The Dub?! scales well for parties of various sizes. Smaller groups (4-6 players) allow everyone multiple chances to write, while larger groups increase the variety and unpredictability of submissions. The browser-based system means no controller limits - anyone with a phone can join.
