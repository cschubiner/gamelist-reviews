# Deviation Game

## Game Overview
Deviation Game is an innovative co-op party game for 2-6 players where creativity meets AI deception. Players' goal is to draw secret prompts in ways that humans can understand but an AI cannot decipher. This unique twist on drawing games creates hilarious situations as players try to communicate with each other while avoiding AI detection.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- Draw prompts that confuse AI but are clear to humans
- 2-6 player cooperative gameplay
- One Steam owner can host for up to 6 players
- Friends join free via smartphone web browsers using QR codes
- Shared/split-screen co-op format
- AI actively tries to interpret drawings
- Players score based on fooling the AI while communicating successfully

## Fun Factor
Deviation Game offers a fresh take on drawing party games by adding the AI element as an adversarial judge. The challenge of drawing something abstract enough to confuse AI but clear enough for friends creates entertaining strategy discussions. Watching the AI's hilariously wrong interpretations generates consistent laughs. The cooperative nature (players vs AI) removes the competitive pressure of traditional drawing games while maintaining engagement. Perfect for groups tired of standard Pictionary-style games who want something new and clever.
