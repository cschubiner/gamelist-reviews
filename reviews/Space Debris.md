## Overview
Space Debris is a local co-op zen space rock demolition game where up to 16 players can play locally on a single screen, collecting space materials to unlock unique ships and upgrades. This family-made indie title focuses on physics-based asteroid destruction in a relaxing, cooperative environment.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game features drop in/out multiplayer functionality, making it easy for players to join or leave at any time. Players work together to demolish space rocks and collect materials, with the goal of unlocking 14 different ships with unique abilities. For solo players, the game includes the option to add an AI ship to help with the gameplay.

The physics-based mechanics create a zen-like experience as players navigate the screen together, breaking apart asteroids and gathering resources. The emphasis is on cooperative play rather than competition.

## Fun Factor
Space Debris offers a casual, relaxing couch co-op experience perfect for families and friend groups. The game's low-pressure, zen approach to space rock demolition creates a soothing gameplay loop, though the simplicity may not appeal to players seeking more complex or competitive experiences.

## Player Count Experience
With support for up to 16 local players on a single screen, Space Debris is designed for maximum couch co-op accessibility. The game scales well from solo play (with AI assistance) to large group sessions. The drop in/out functionality makes it easy to accommodate varying group sizes without interrupting gameplay.

### Key Takeaways
Space Debris is a charming indie project that delivers on its promise of local co-op fun. The family-made origin story adds to its appeal, and at $1.99, it represents strong value for players seeking casual couch co-op experiences. However, the lack of online multiplayer and limited review coverage suggests a smaller player base. The game is best suited for families and casual players rather than competitive gamers.
