Players can entertain friends at their house, play remotely with online pals, or host a DIY game show for stream audiences. The game offers unique Discord Integration, allowing players to connect the game to their Discord voice chat so friends can jump into the game with one click and play using the Discord UI.

The guided experience makes the game accessible to players of all skill levels, while the novel mechanics add a new depth of skills to master for experienced social deduction fans.
