# The Jackbox Naughty Pack Review

## Overview
The Jackbox Naughty Pack is Jackbox Games' first adult-themed party pack, released in September 2024. Unlike the standard Party Packs that include five games, the Naughty Pack contains three games with mature content and adult humor, offered at a reduced price point.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The pack includes three games with NSFW themes:
- **Fakin' It All Night Long:** An adult version of the social deduction game where players identify the faker
- **Dirty Drawful:** A mature twist on the drawing and guessing game
- **Let Me Finish:** A new game focused on adult-themed prompts and responses

All games support up to 8 active players with additional audience members, maintaining the smartphone-as-controller format that Jackbox is known for.

## Fun Factor
The pack delivers the chaotic, fun gameplay that Jackbox fans expect, with the added element of adult humor. Reviews note that "Fakin' It All Night Long" is a favorite that relies on quick wits and provides the most laughs.

However, the forced adult theming is a double-edged sword - while it can be entertaining for the right group, critics noted the NSFW content "feels a little forced at times, in both the presentation and the general vibe," and the "inconsistent NSFW-ness often detracts from the series' comedy value."

## Player Count Experience
- **Active Players:** Up to 8 players (varies by game)
- **Audience Members:** Additional spectators can participate
- **Best For:** Adult groups of 4-8 players

The games work best with mature audiences comfortable with adult humor and themes.

## Platforms
- Steam (PC)
- PlayStation
- Xbox
- Nintendo Switch

## Pricing
- **Standard Price:** $19.99-$20.69
- **Value Consideration:** Reduced price compared to standard Party Packs (which contain 5 games)

## Overall Reception

### Critical Scores
Mixed to positive reception, with praise for gameplay tempered by criticism of value and forced content

### Critical Reception Summary
**Positive Aspects:**
- Successfully wrangles "the fun and chaotic gameplay that partygoers and friend groups expect from Jackbox Games"
- Fakin' It All Night Long is highly praised for relying on quick wits
- Appropriate for adult game nights

**Criticisms:**
- "Feels lacking for only having three games included compared to the usual five"
- "Adult theming feels a little forced at times"
- "Inconsistent NSFW-ness often detracts from the series' comedy value"
- "Forced filth that works some of the time"

### Strengths
- Maintains Jackbox's quality gameplay mechanics
- Fakin' It All Night Long is a standout game
- Good option for adults-only game nights
- Smartphone controller integration
- Lower price than standard packs
- Fills a niche for mature party games

### Weaknesses
- Only three games vs. five in standard packs
- Forced adult themes feel inauthentic at times
- Inconsistent tone across games
- Less value overall than regular Party Packs
- Adult humor may not land with all groups
- Smaller content offering for similar development quality

## Verdict
The Jackbox Naughty Pack succeeds in bringing adult-themed party gaming to the Jackbox formula, but with notable compromises. While the gameplay maintains Jackbox's quality and Fakin' It All Night Long is a genuine highlight, the pack feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy rather than naturally incorporating mature content. The reduction to three games makes it feel less substantial than standard Party Packs, even with the lower price point. Best suited for adult groups specifically seeking NSFW party games who understand they're getting less content than a standard pack. If your group enjoys adult humor and wants a change from standard Jackbox fare, it's worth considering - just set expectations accordingly for the reduced game count and somewhat forced mature themes.
