## Overview
PengoRoyale is a fun, colorful, competitive, couch-brawling battle royale where players fight for dominance on the ice as penguins. It's a mind-blowing, friend-ruining, massively-local-player Battle Royale designed specifically for couch play. The goal is to be the last penguin standing as the ice crumbles beneath you.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Your objective is to eliminate all other players by kicking icebergs to crush them. Players must grab power-ups and boost away from danger while the ice melts rapidly. Don't be caught when it crumbles! The shrinking play area creates increasing tension as the match progresses, true to the battle royale genre.

The game offers 11 opponents maximum (for 12-player total), making it one of the few local battle royales that support this many players simultaneously. The simple controls (requiring controllers only) make it accessible to players of all skill levels, but mastering the timing and positioning adds depth for competitive play.

## Fun Factor
PengoRoyale is described as "super simple to play, impossible to master" - a perfect formula for party game fun. The colorful visual style and penguin theme add charm without sacrificing the competitive intensity. Matches are quick (true to the "itty bitty little bites" description), making it easy to play multiple rounds without fatigue.

The friend-ruining chaos of battle royale gameplay translates well to local multiplayer, creating the kind of shouting matches and celebrations that make great couch gaming memories.

## Player Count Experience
The 2-12 player range is impressive for a local battle royale. Two players provides a focused 1v1 experience, while 12 players creates absolute chaos on screen. The sweet spot is likely 4-8 players where there's enough competition without overwhelming the screen.

The strict controller requirement (no keyboard and mouse) means you need adequate controllers for everyone, which could be a barrier for some groups. However, this ensures consistent control schemes for fair competition.

### Key Takeaways
PengoRoyale is a niche title that delivers on its specific promise: bringing battle royale gameplay to local couch co-op. The lack of extensive reviews makes it difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment, but the core concept is sound and fills a gap in the party game market.

The game's biggest strengths are:

Potential drawbacks include:
- Requires multiple controllers (minimum 2, no keyboard support)
