# Big Screen Games - Pack 1 Review

## Overview
Big Screen Games - Pack 1 is a party game collection designed for local multiplayer gaming where players gather around a TV, laptop, or tablet. Despite its name, this is not a VR experience but rather a traditional screen-based party game where players use their smartphones as controllers.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The pack includes three party games:
- **Herd Mentality**: A game where players try to think like the majority
- **Scrawl**: A drawing and guessing game similar to Telephone/Chinese Whispers
- **Can of Squirms**: A question-based game that likely involves revealing and discussing personal preferences or scenarios

Players scan a QR code with their phones to join the game, turning their smartphones into controllers. This setup eliminates the need for multiple physical controllers and makes it easy for groups to jump into games quickly.

## Fun Factor
TechRaptor noted the game offers "tons of fun and flexibility," suggesting that the three included games provide varied entertainment suitable for different group preferences. The phone-as-controller setup makes it accessible and easy to get started, reducing barriers to entry for party gaming.

The games are designed to create social interaction and laughter, following the successful formula of other phone-controller party games like the Jackbox series.

## Player Count Experience
The game is designed for local multiplayer, with players gathering around a shared screen. While specific player count limits weren't detailed in available information, the phone-controller setup typically supports groups of 4-8+ players.

The single-screen format encourages a couch party atmosphere where everyone can see the action and react together.
