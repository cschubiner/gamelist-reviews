# Click on pina coladas together

## Gameplay & Mechanics

Click on pina coladas together is a multiplayer hidden object game featuring an incredibly detailed hand-drawn panoramic scene containing 100+ pina coladas to discover. Players compete to locate and click these tropical drinks, marking them in their chosen color before other players can claim them.

Navigation through the panoramic artwork is accomplished by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or alternatively using keyboard controls (WASD, TFGH, IJKL, or arrow keys) or gamepads. This multi-input support allows different players to use their preferred control method simultaneously.

When a player finds a pina colada, clicking it marks it in their selected color and adds it to their score. A final scoreboard displays who found what once all objects are discovered. The game offers customizable color themes to reduce eye strain during extended play sessions.

The game includes a comprehensive feature set: one hand-drawn panoramic level, 100+ hidden objects, in-game chat functionality, unlimited hints for players who get stuck, paced achievements for milestone moments, different color theme options, and relaxing music that can be disabled if preferred.

Multiplayer connectivity options include local play with various input devices, Steam Remote Play, LAN over WiFi, and experimental online play that doesn't require port forwarding. There's no time limit, creating a relaxed atmosphere that prioritizes enjoyment over speed.

## Fun Factor

Click on pina coladas together offers a tropical, vacation-themed search experience that's inherently cheerful and relaxing. The pina colada theme evokes beaches, relaxation, and fun times, creating a positive atmosphere that enhances the casual gaming experience.

The unlimited hints system is a thoughtful addition that prevents frustration - players who get stuck can get assistance rather than becoming discouraged. The in-game chat enables communication and banter among players, enhancing the social aspect of the competition.

The competitive element remains gentle despite the race to find objects. The absence of time pressure allows for conversation and social bonding during play. The relaxing music option reinforces the vacation vibe, though players can disable it if they prefer quiet or their own music.

The paced achievements create natural moments of excitement throughout the search, celebrating the first find, halfway point, and final discoveries.

## Player Count Experience

Click on pina coladas together supports unlimited players, constrained only by available input devices. The variety of control options (mouse, multiple keyboard layouts, gamepads, Steam Remote Play, LAN, and experimental online) provides exceptional flexibility for different group configurations.

The shared-screen format creates a communal experience where all players view the same tropical scene. The in-game chat feature enables text communication, which is particularly valuable during online play where voice chat may not be available. The color-coded marking system provides immediate visual feedback on everyone's progress.

The game scales effectively across player counts. Solo players can enjoy a peaceful, vacation-themed search, pairs engage in friendly competition, and larger groups create livelier searches. The unlimited player support makes it suitable for virtual beach parties or tropical-themed gatherings.
