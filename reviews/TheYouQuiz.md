# The You Quiz

## Game Overview
The You Quiz is a unique multiplayer party game where the questions are all about YOU! Players take turns being the King who judges answers about themselves, while others act as Courtiers trying to guess the King's quirks, tastes, and dreams. The game personalizes trivia by making each player the subject of questions, creating intimate and revealing gameplay moments.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

- Players answer personal questions about the King's preferences and life
- King judges which answers are closest or most accurate
- Real-time simultaneous answering keeps gameplay moving
- Over 1,000 personal questions for endless variety
- Phone/tablet controllers for all players

## Fun Factor
The You Quiz excels at creating intimate, revealing moments that help friends learn surprising things about each other. The personal nature of questions makes every round feel unique and meaningful. Unlike generic trivia, the focus on individual players creates investment in each answer. The King role adds a fun judging element where players can award points creatively. Perfect for breaking the ice or deepening existing friendships. The huge question pool means you'll rarely see repeats, and each game feels tailored to your specific group.
