## Gameplay & Mechanics

**Core Format:**
- Players use smartphones as controllers while a central device (PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox) displays the main game
- Games span multiple genres: drawing/design, collaborative writing, trivia, rhythm, and social deduction
- Includes family-friendly toggle options and subtitle support for accessibility

**Individual Game Mechanics:**

- **Tee K.O. 2**: Players create t-shirt designs and slogans that get mixed and matched. Adds customizable clothing options and the ability to edit others' drawings in round two.

- **Timejinx**: Timeline-based trivia where players guess the year of historical events. Scoring rewards accuracy (closer guesses = fewer points).

- **FixyText**: Collaborative writing game where teams simultaneously type responses with the backspace/delete keys disabled, creating chaotic and hilarious results.

- **Dodo Re Mi**: Rhythm game where up to 9 players select instruments at different difficulty levels and must synchronize patterns. Everyone succeeds or fails together.

- **Hypnotorious**: Social deduction game where players receive secret identities, answer questions in character, then guess which other players share categories.
