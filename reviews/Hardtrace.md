# Hardtrace

## Overview
Hardtrace is a party arcade game that reimagines the classic tron-like and snake-like gameplay with modern innovations. Supporting up to 12+ players on a single screen (with network support for even more), the game brings fast-paced competitive action where players pilot "Tracer" vehicles that leave deadly trails behind them.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Hardtrace takes the familiar concept of trail-based competitive gameplay and adds several innovative mechanics:

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Tracer Vehicles:** Players drive vehicles that leave intermittent deadly trails, creating hazards for all players
- **Instant Cornering:** Quick direction changes allow for rapid evasive maneuvers and surprise attacks
- **Speed Control:** Players can accelerate and brake, adding tactical depth to movement
- **Portals:** Create and use portals to traverse the arena quickly and reach high-value areas before opponents

**Gameplay Zones:**
The game features two difficulty levels of zones with different risk-reward dynamics:
- **Standard Zones:** Safer areas with normal point values
- **Heated Battle Zones:** High-value point areas requiring more precise control and strategy, where competition intensifies as players rush to enter and dominate these lucrative spaces

**Scoring System:**
Players compete during timed rounds to accumulate maximum points through survival, strategic positioning, and eliminating opponents with their trails. The portal system adds a layer of strategy, allowing skilled players to reach valuable positions faster than competitors.

## Fun Factor
Hardtrace delivers fast-paced arcade action that emphasizes quick reflexes, spatial awareness, and tactical thinking. The instant cornering mechanic creates opportunities for both clever plays and close calls, while the portal system adds strategic depth beyond simple survival.

The heated battle zones create natural focal points for competition, forcing players into confrontations as everyone tries to claim high-value areas. The combination of offensive trail-laying and defensive maneuvering keeps gameplay dynamic and engaging.

With support for 12+ players on one screen, the game can create chaotic and entertaining party experiences where the arena becomes increasingly dangerous as more trails appear.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** Up to 12+ players on a single PC, with network support for even more

Hardtrace is designed as a party game that shines with large player counts. The 12+ player support on a single screen makes it ideal for party settings, game nights, and competitive gatherings. Network play extends the player count even further for larger events.

The game scales well across different player counts:
- Smaller groups (2-4 players) offer more strategic, tactical gameplay
- Mid-size groups (5-8 players) balance strategy with chaos
- Large groups (9-12+) create hectic, unpredictable action

The timed round structure keeps matches moving and allows for multiple games in a session, making it easy to accommodate players joining or leaving.
