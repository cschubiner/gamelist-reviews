# Turing Quest Review

## Overview
Turing Quest is a unique party game where players compete against an AI that has been trained to be funny. In this human-versus-machine comedy competition, players and their friends write jokes and compete with AI-generated responses, with participants voting on whether human or AI humor is better.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game pits human creativity against artificial intelligence in a battle of wit and humor. Players write jokes in response to prompts, and these are presented alongside AI-generated jokes. The audience then votes on which responses are funnier, without knowing which came from humans and which from the AI.

Turing Quest supports:
- **Main Players:** Up to 4 players (local multiplayer)
- **Extended Players:** Up to 6 main players
- **Audience Participation:** Up to 50 additional people can join to participate in voting rounds

This format creates an engaging social experience that questions the nature of humor and creativity while providing entertainment through both human and AI-generated comedy.

## Fun Factor
The premise is inherently intriguing in the age of AI - can a machine be funnier than humans? This question drives the gameplay and creates memorable moments as players try to outwit an algorithm. The voting rounds allow larger groups to participate beyond just the main players, making it excellent for parties where not everyone can be an active contestant.

The game taps into contemporary fascination with AI capabilities while maintaining the social, competitive aspects that make party games engaging.

## Player Count Experience
- **Local Multiplayer:** Up to 4 players
- **Main Players:** Up to 6 players
- **Audience Voters:** Up to 50 additional participants
- **Best For:** Groups of 4-10 players (with additional audience members)

The audience feature significantly expands the game's reach, allowing large gatherings to participate even if only a few are writing jokes.
