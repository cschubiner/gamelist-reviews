# Spaceteam VR Review

## Overview
Spaceteam VR is a cooperative virtual reality party game based on the popular mobile game Spaceteam. Players work together as a spaceship crew, frantically coordinating to operate their vessel while shouting instructions at each other in a race against time and the dark void of space.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Up to six players must work together to survive as long as possible by following instructions, pressing buttons, pulling levers, and communicating effectively. The game creates a "hypnotic spell" where players find themselves "screaming at best friends" as they struggle to coordinate under pressure.

A unique feature is the hybrid gameplay: at least one VR headset is required, but players without headsets can join via smartphone using an official mobile app. Mobile players are represented as robots in the VR game, allowing mixed VR/non-VR groups to play together. The game also supports local play with connected smart devices.

## Fun Factor
UploadVR described the game as "quite a delight," praising how well the cooperative chaos translates to VR. The frantic nature of shouting instructions and coordinating under time pressure creates memorable, hilarious moments that exemplify what makes party games entertaining.

However, the game has received mixed reviews overall, with only 50% positive ratings on Steam, suggesting the experience may not consistently meet expectations for all players.

- **Players:** Up to 6 players
- **VR Requirements:** At least 1 VR headset required
