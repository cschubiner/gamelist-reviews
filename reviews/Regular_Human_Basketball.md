## Gameplay Overview

**Core Concept**: Players control tiny humans running around inside giant basketball-playing robots in a post-apocalyptic setting. Rather than directly controlling the mechs, players must physically run to different control stations inside the robots and press buttons to operate various functions like thrusters, magnet arms, and wheels.

**Game Comparison**: Described by the developers as a fusion between QWOP (deliberate awkward controls) and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime (cooperative station management).

## Mechanics

### Control System
- **Deliberately obtuse controls** that require cooperative coordination
- Players must jump inside mechs and run between control stations
- Risk of being crushed by the robot's moving parts or falling out
- Each function (thrusters, rotation, magnet arm, wheels) requires manual activation
- Uncooperative physics create chaotic, unpredictable gameplay

### Technical Features
- Local co-op and online multiplayer support
- Private and public online matches
- Built-in GIF saving functionality
- Steam Controller compatibility
- Supports 2-10 players per match (1-5 per team)

### Entertainment Value
