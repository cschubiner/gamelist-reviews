# Traffic Jams

## Game Overview
Traffic Jams is a tongue-in-cheek VR traffic control simulation with asymmetrical multiplayer capabilities. The VR player takes on the role of a traffic controller managing chaotic intersections using gesture-based controls, while up to four friends on mobile devices can join to either help or hilariously sabotage operations by calling in events like meteor strikes.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
- VR traffic control simulation with gesture-based controls
- Manage increasingly chaotic traffic scenarios
- Asymmetrical multiplayer: 1 VR player + up to 4 mobile players
- Mobile players direct traffic and trigger events
- Wave-based gameplay with escalating difficulty
- Various events and disasters to manage
- Single-player campaign mode available
- Supports cross-buy on some platforms

## Fun Factor
Traffic Jams delivers satisfying VR gameplay through its excellent gesture-based control system that feels intuitive and responsive. The single-player mode provides good challenge and progression, while multiplayer adds chaotic party game fun. Watching the VR player frantically manage traffic while friends sabotage from phones creates hilarious moments. The tongue-in-cheek tone keeps frustration light. However, reviews indicate multiplayer is less engaging than single-player, as mobile players have limited interaction. Best enjoyed as a VR showcase title with occasional multiplayer chaos rather than primary multiplayer game.
