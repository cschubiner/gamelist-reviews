## GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS

**Core Mechanic:**
- One-button control system (described as "like multiplayer Flappy Bird")
- Players bounce up and down with each button press, with press duration controlling flight height
- Objective: Last player standing wins
- Players lose hearts by touching floors, walls, ceilings, or getting hit by other players
- Includes obstacles to avoid and power-ups to collect

**Comparison:**
- Frequently described as "like Flappy Bird and Joust (Atari/Arcade) had a meth baby"
- Homage to the classic arcade game Joust

## FUN FACTOR

**Positive Aspects:**
- Described as "simple manic fun"
- "The most fun you can have offline, playing with your friends"
- "Wonderfully addictive"
- Features "clever depth and capacity to be used as a quickie or a new addiction to skill growth"

**Intensity:**
- Gets "freakin insane" with more players
- Difficulty and chaos scale significantly with player count
- Testing with 7+ players showed exponentially increased challenge

## PLAYER COUNT EXPERIENCE

**Scalability:**
- Supports 2-16 players
- Sweet spot appears to be 4-7 players based on user feedback
- More players = more chaos and difficulty

**Technical Considerations:**
- Local multiplayer only (couch co-op)
- Standard keyboards limited to ~4 simultaneous key presses
- **Recommendation:** Use controllers to balance players across input devices for larger groups
- Unusual for PC gaming as a dedicated local multiplayer title
