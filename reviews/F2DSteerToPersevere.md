# F2D - Steer To Persevere

## Overview
F2D - Steer To Persevere (Formula 2D) is a Formula racing game developed by Zyg Studios, a one-person development team (zyg101). The game offers both single-player and multiplayer racing modes inspired by Formula racing, providing a casual yet engaging racing experience at an accessible price point.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
F2D delivers Formula-style racing in a 2D format with multiple game modes catering to different play styles:

**Game Modes:**
- **Career Mode:** Become the best racing team through progression
- **Championship:** Compete in full championship series
- **Single Race:** Quick races for instant action
- **Time Trials:** Study tracks and perfect racing lines
- **Multiplayer:** Race directly against other players or compete against their ghost times

**Racing Mechanics:**
The game focuses on Formula racing fundamentals adapted to 2D gameplay. Players manage racing lines, speed, and strategy across various tracks. Time Trials mode specifically allows players to learn track layouts and optimize their performance.

**Control Considerations:**
Reviews note the game is designed for controller play, with gamepad being the recommended control method. However, some menu navigation may still require keyboard and mouse, which reviewers found inconsistent.

## Fun Factor
F2D provides what GameGrin describes as "completely fine, casual racing" that makes an effective introduction to Formula racing while offering fun multiplayer competition. The game delivers accessible racing action without overwhelming complexity.

The variety of modes prevents gameplay from becoming repetitive - Career mode offers progression, Championships provide structured competition, and Time Trials allow perfectionist players to optimize every corner. The ghost racing feature in multiplayer adds competitive elements even when playing solo.

As a solo development project, the game demonstrates impressive scope and ambition. Players interested in supporting indie development will appreciate the effort behind the content variety.

## Player Count Experience
**Supported Players:** Single-player and multiplayer (specific player count details limited)

The game offers both solo and multiplayer racing:
- **Single-Player:** Career mode, Championships, Time Trials, and Single Races
- **Multiplayer:** Direct competition against other players online
- **Ghost Racing:** Compete against recorded times from other players

The multiplayer implementation allows for both synchronous racing (live competition) and asynchronous competition (ghost times), providing flexibility in how players compete.
