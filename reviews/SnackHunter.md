# SnackHunter

## Gameplay & Mechanics

SnackHunter is a multiplayer hide-and-seek game that supports up to 16 players using smartphones as controllers. Players are divided into two teams: the Hunters and the Snacks, with the Snacks attempting to escape becoming a soup side dish while the Hunters try to catch them.

The game features unique smartphone-based interactions that go beyond simple button presses. Players can physically interact with their phones in creative ways - wiping tomato paste off their screens or blowing into their microphones to escape fire attacks. These interactive elements add a physical, party-game dimension to the digital experience.

The game can be played both locally and online. In local mode, the PC screen displays crucial game information and an overhead map view that both teams can use strategically. This shared-screen approach combined with individual phone controls creates an engaging hybrid setup. For online play, players can easily create rooms that friends can join remotely.

Each team has access to unique abilities that create asymmetric gameplay, encouraging different strategies for Hunters and Snacks. The hide-and-seek mechanics are enhanced by these special powers, making each match dynamic and unpredictable.

## Fun Factor

SnackHunter's innovative use of smartphone capabilities makes it stand out in the party game space. The physical interactions - wiping and blowing into phones - create memorable, often hilarious moments that enhance the social experience. The absurd premise of snacks running from hungry hunters adds humor and lightheartedness to the gameplay.

The asymmetric team structure keeps gameplay interesting, as playing as a Hunter versus a Snack provides distinctly different experiences. The strategic use of the overhead map on the shared PC screen adds depth, allowing both teams to plan movements and coordinate attacks or escapes.

The 16-player support means the game can accommodate large parties, and the ability to play both locally and online makes it versatile for different social situations. The no-app-required smartphone controller system removes setup friction, letting groups jump into games quickly.

## Player Count Experience

SnackHunter supports 2-16 players, making it suitable for both small groups and large gatherings. The hide-and-seek format scales well with player counts - more players create more chaos and opportunities for clever plays, while smaller groups allow for more tactical, strategic gameplay.

The team-based structure ensures everyone is engaged at the same time, unlike sequential hide-and-seek games where players might wait extended periods. The 16-player maximum puts it among the higher-capacity party games, though it falls short of some competitors that support 20+ players.

Both local and online multiplayer support means the game can adapt to different scenarios - whether you're hosting an in-person party or connecting with friends remotely.
