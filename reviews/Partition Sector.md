## Overview
Partition Sector is a Bomberman-style game with a focus on team modes and massive local multiplayer support. Developed by Arganoid Industries, it takes the classic maze-based bomb-placing formula and expands it with multiple game modes and support for up to 20 simultaneous players.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
The game features 7 game modes including Battle Royale, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Snake Hunter, and a unique mode called EVERYTHING where all game modes play out simultaneously. Players navigate maze-like arenas, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and opponents while avoiding explosions.

Only one player needs to own the game to host online sessions via Steam Remote Play Together, making it economical for groups. The variety of modes prevents the Bomberman formula from feeling stale, with each mode offering different objectives and strategies.

## Fun Factor
Partition Sector delivers chaotic fun, especially with larger groups. The EVERYTHING mode, where multiple game modes run simultaneously, creates hilariously unpredictable situations. While the graphics are admittedly basic, the gameplay itself is solid and engaging. The humor and creative mechanics shine through despite the simple visual presentation.

## Player Count Experience
With support for up to 20 local players, Partition Sector excels at large gatherings. The team-focused modes work particularly well with mid-to-large groups, allowing for strategic coordination. Smaller groups can still enjoy the game, but it truly comes alive with 6+ players creating mayhem on screen. The Steam Remote Play Together feature expands multiplayer options beyond local couch co-op.

## Overall Reception

### Critic Scores
- **Steam Curator (SvenEvil's Playground):** "Bomberman clone with awful graphics but good gameplay and some really nice ideas"
- Limited professional review coverage

### User Scores
- **Steam:** Mixed reviews with positive feedback for gameplay
- **itch.io:** Positive comments praising humor and creative mechanics

### Key Takeaways
Partition Sector is a "don't judge a book by its cover" situation. While reviewers universally acknowledge the graphics are rough, they praise the gameplay innovations and variety of modes. The EVERYTHING mode represents a creative approach to party game design that few other titles attempt. At $3.99, it's an affordable option for groups seeking Bomberman-style action with modern twists.

The game is best suited for players who prioritize gameplay over presentation and who have access to multiple controllers for local multiplayer. The lack of online matchmaking (relying instead on Remote Play Together) may limit its appeal for some players.
