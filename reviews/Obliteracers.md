# Obliteracers: Review Summary

## Game Overview
Obliteracers is a combat-focused kart racing game that supports up to 16 players (PC version) and features a unique camera system that follows the race leader, with players who fall behind being eliminated. Released in 2016 across multiple platforms (PC, PS4, Xbox One).

## Gameplay & Mechanics

### Positive Aspects:
- **Unique camera system**: The partly top-down camera that follows the race leader creates an innovative twist on traditional kart racing
- **Defensive mechanics**: Players can block incoming weapons by dropping their power-ups, creating good balance
- **Weapon variety**: Features machine guns, missiles, grease, force fields, and other creative power-ups
- **16-player chaos**: The large player count creates hectic, fluid action (PC version)

### Critical Issues:
- **Control problems**: Karts are extremely slippery, making precise control difficult
- **Disjointed pacing**: When points are scored, races reset, which interrupts flow and "zaps away the fun"
- **Camera confusion**: With many players on screen, it's very difficult to track your own racer
- **Generic modes**: Four game modes available, but three are "fairly generic" and two are "almost identical"
- **Limited variety**: Fails to provide enough gameplay variation despite multiple modes

**Critic Quote (TheSixthAxis, 7/10):** "The raw mechanics are tuned to give Obliteracers a frantic, sometimes nonsensical feel."

## Fun Factor

### When It's Fun:
- Excellent as a party game with friends in the same room
- Hectic 16-player races create memorable chaos
- Works well for short 30-minute sessions
- Weapons are entertaining and add variety

### When It's Not:
- Single-player campaign is "short and rather dull" with limited lifespan
- Track design is "a tad boring" despite aesthetically appealing visuals
- Can be "too chaotic at times" and won't click for everyone
- AI opponents use "cheap and infuriating tactics"

**Critic Quote (Hey Poor Player, 2.5/5):** "The weapon variety is very fun to use, but the single-player campaign lacks very clearly in most areas of execution."

## Player Count Experience

### Local Multiplayer (Highly Praised):
- **Best feature of the game** - "Local play is really where the game excels"
- Players compete on the same full-screen, avoiding split-screen issues
- Transforms frustrations into humorous moments similar to Mario Party
- "Excellent experience for local multiplayer sessions"
- **Limitation**: Console versions only support 4 players vs. 16 on PC

### Online Multiplayer (Mixed):
- 16-player support with drop-in/drop-out functionality
- **Major flaw**: No matchmaking feature - can't find random strangers unless someone is hosting
- "Dead lobbies" were a common problem at launch
- Works well when you can find active games

### Single-Player (Weak):
- 24-stage career mode lacks depth
- Not recommended for solo play
- Hard to justify purchase without multiplayer options
- AI opponents detract from enjoyment

**Critic Quote (Push Square, 5/10):** "You need to be in the same room to get the most out of it."

## Overall Reception

### Critical Scores:
- **OpenCritic Average**: 67/100 (Fair) - 14 critics
- **Steam User Reviews**: 65% positive (167 reviews)
- **Push Square**: 5/10 (Average)
- **TheSixthAxis**: 7/10
- **Hey Poor Player**: 2.5/5
- **Video Chums**: 6.9/10

### Consensus:
**Strengths:**
- Creative mechanics and unique camera system
- Fantastic local multiplayer party game
- Hectic, fluid combat racing when played with friends
- Good weapon variety and customization options

**Weaknesses:**
- Weak single-player campaign
- Control and camera issues
- Lack of online matchmaking
- Disjointed gameplay flow due to race resets
- Limited mode variety despite multiple options

### Final Verdict:
Obliteracers is a niche party game that excels in local multiplayer scenarios but struggles everywhere else. Critics unanimously agree it's designed for couch co-op experiences with friends rather than solo play or serious racing competition. At its $14.99 launch price, it was considered acceptable for party game enthusiasts but not recommended for those seeking a robust kart racer like Mario Kart or a substantial single-player experience.

**Best For**: Party game enthusiasts with friends who enjoy chaotic multiplayer mayhem
**Avoid If**: You primarily play solo or want a polished, competitive kart racing experience
